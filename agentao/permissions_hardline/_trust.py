r"""Trusted resolution: who may be launched, from where, and with what environment.

PR-4 of the PowerShell ladder. ``IMG-01`` through ``IMG-09``, ``ENV-01`` through ``ENV-06``,
``LAUNCH-02`` through ``LAUNCH-09``, ``LADDER-01``, ``LADDER-03``, ``NAME-02``, ``NAME-03``,
``SPEC-04a`` and ``SPEC-05`` are each defined once in
``docs/design/powershell-support-spec.zh.md`` §2, and transcribed as typed signatures in
``docs/design/powershell-support-contracts.py``.

**One predicate, three consumers.** IMG-01 asks a single question — *can the token this child
will run as modify, delete, replace or rename this path, or any ancestor of it up to the
volume root?* Interpreter selection, the image half of the closed runnable set, and the
child's ``PATH`` filter are all that same question asked about different paths. Writing it
three times is writing three chances to answer it differently.

**Everything the answer depends on comes from the oracle, and the oracle is bound to one
subject** (SPEC-05). Access masks, reparse points, signatures, the target's base environment
and its project root are facts about the machine the command will run on, which is not
necessarily the machine the floor is running on. A remote executor supplies its own oracle;
the local one answers for this host. Neither is consulted for a policy-off rung, because
there is nothing there to attest.

**Nothing here is reachable in production yet.** Every rung constructible today is policy-off
(``LADDER-05``), so :func:`select_rung` returns through its two legacy branches and the
attested path below them is exercised only by tests with an injected oracle — which is what
every PR-4 gate row in ``docs/design/powershell-support-gates.zh.md`` does.
