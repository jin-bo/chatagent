"""Permission-rule file loader.

:func:`load_permission_rules` reads ``<user_root>/permissions.json`` and
returns the parsed rule list plus the source labels the engine surfaces
through :meth:`PermissionEngine.active_permissions`. Project-scope
``<project_root>/.agentao/permissions.json`` is intentionally NOT
loaded — see :class:`agentao.permissions.PermissionEngine` for the
reasoning — but its presence triggers a one-line warning so users
discover the policy.

**This file fails closed.** Every other config reader in the tree warns
and degrades to its default when the file is unreadable, mis-encoded,
malformed, or the wrong shape; this one raises
:class:`PermissionConfigError` and lets session construction abort. The
asymmetry is the point: dropping permission rules is not a neutral
degradation. A user ``deny`` on a shell or web tool degrades to ASK, and
a ``deny`` on an ``mcp_*`` tool degrades to *nothing at all* — the engine
returns ``None``, the runtime falls through to the tool's own
``requires_confirmation``, and a ``trust: true`` server's tool then runs
with no prompt. A log line does not close that; refusing to start does.
The convention already exists in the tree: ``acp_client/config.py``
raises ``AcpConfigError`` for a malformed ``acp.json``.

The ``is_file()`` pre-check is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Without
it a *missing* file reaches the ``OSError`` branch, which now raises —
i.e. agentao would refuse to start for every user who has never written
a permissions file, which is the common case.

This module owns everything **document**-shaped: that the top level is an
object, the ``rules`` key, and the path in the error message.
:func:`agentao.permissions.validate_permission_rules` owns everything
**rule-list**-shaped and is shared with the two callers that never see a
document (``PermissionEngine(rules=...)`` and ``add_run_rules()``).
