    (or ``USERPROFILE`` on Windows) is unset *and* there is no
    password-database entry for the current user. This happens in
    stripped service accounts, some container and CI sandboxes, and
    headless launches (e.g. an ACP client spawning us with a minimal
    environment). Rather than let that crash an import or a turn, fall
    back to a writable location so user-scope state still has a home.

    The fallback is a *private, per-user* subdirectory of the system temp
    dir. The temp root is world-writable and shared between users, so the
    directory is created ``0700`` and validated to be owned by the current
    user with no group/other access before it is trusted — otherwise a
    local attacker could pre-create the predictable path and have us load
    their ``plugins`` / ``skills`` / ``sandbox.json`` as user-scope state.
    A pre-existing path that fails that check is abandoned for a fresh
    private ``mkdtemp`` rather than trusted.

    The normal path (a resolvable home) does no filesystem I/O; only the

    everything — and ``_private_dir_or_mkdtemp`` then falls through to ``mkdtemp`` on *every
    call*, giving a different state directory each run. That is worse than the check it was
    protecting: config and memory land somewhere new each time.

    So Windows gets the guarantee it actually has. The fallback directory is created under
    ``tempfile.gettempdir()``, which there is ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp`` — per user by
    construction — and what is checked is that the path is a real directory rather than a
    symlink or a reparse point pointing elsewhere.

    **The limit, stated rather than glossed:** if ``TEMP`` has been redirected to a shared
    directory this is weaker than the POSIX test, because answering "can another account
    write here" needs an ACL check. That question has an owner — the identity oracle in
    ``permissions_hardline/_trust.py`` — and no implementation on Windows yet.
