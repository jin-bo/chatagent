"""Per-server subprocess handle for ACP client.

Each configured ACP server gets one :class:`ACPProcessHandle` that owns the
``subprocess.Popen`` instance and tracks the runtime state machine.

This module handles **only** process lifecycle (start / stop / restart) and
stderr consumption.  JSON-RPC framing, handshake, and request routing are
layered on top in Issues 03–04.

#: How long to wait for a just-started server to die before calling it started.
#:
#: 50 ms is enough on POSIX, where ``fork``/``exec`` is cheap. It is not enough on Windows,
#: where creating a process and starting an interpreter routinely takes longer than that —
#: a server that crashes on startup has not *reached* its crash yet when the window closes,
#: so the check reports it as running and the failure resurfaces later as a broken pipe.
#: Measured on the Windows job, where the same test passed on one Python and failed on
#: another purely on timing.
#:
#: The cost is paid by healthy servers, which block for the whole window: ``wait`` returns
#: early only when the child exits. That is the trade — a slower start for a check that
#: works — and it is why the longer wait is scoped to the platform that needs it.
