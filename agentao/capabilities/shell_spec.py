"""The shell dialect vocabulary and the launch request agentao hands an executor.

This module is the runtime half of §3 of ``docs/design/powershell-support-spec.zh.md``;
``docs/design/powershell-support-contracts.py`` is the typed contract it is transcribed
from, and every rule ID below (``SPEC-01``, ``LAUNCH-01`` …) is defined there exactly once.

**What this module is for.** Today a shell command is a string that reaches
``subprocess.Popen(shell=True)``, so what actually interprets it is whatever the platform
picks — ``%COMSPEC% /c`` on Windows, ``/bin/bash`` or ``/bin/sh`` elsewhere. The floor that
inspects that string is written for POSIX shell syntax. On Windows that mismatch means the
floor is scanning cmd syntax with POSIX patterns, which is why its Windows token hit rate is
zero. Naming the dialect is the first step out of that, and the dialect has to travel *with*
the decision rather than be re-derived at spawn time.

**PR-1 changes shapes, not behaviour.** Every rung this module can construct today is
policy-off (``legacy_cmd`` on Windows, ``system_posix`` elsewhere, see ``LADDER-05``), and a
policy-off rung launches through :class:`LegacyLaunch`, which is field-for-field what
``ShellRequest`` carried before: the command string, the call's working directory, and
``build_child_env()``'s inherited-minus-credentials environment. The attested variants exist
and are enforced, but nothing constructs one until the trusted-resolution PR.
