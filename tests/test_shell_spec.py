"""The shell spec, the launch request, and the two guards that come with them.

PR-1 of the PowerShell ladder (``docs/design/powershell-support-implementation.zh.md``).
Every test names the rule ID it holds; the rules are defined once each in
``docs/design/powershell-support-spec.zh.md`` §2.

The thing worth stating up front: at this stage **nothing changes what runs**. Every rung
that can be constructed is policy-off, and a policy-off rung launches through the same three
fields the request carried before. These tests are here so that stays true, and so the
shapes the later stages fill are already refusing what they must refuse.
